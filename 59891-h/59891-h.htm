PREFATORY NOTE
</p>

<p>
The purpose of this volume is to
commemorate the life and death of Reginald
John Godfrey Bateman, first Professor of
English at the University of Saskatchewan.
It was felt by the Governors and Faculty of
the University that his friends and old students
would value a representative selection from
the lectures delivered by him within the
University and to the outside public.  Included
in the selection are a few poems which were
found among his papers.  The lectures and
essays which are published here, being written
for popular audiences or literary gatherings
inside the University, were never intended by their
author for publication as the original and
considered critical work of a Professor of English;
doubtless, if such had been his purpose, much
that is printed here, originally hurriedly
prepared during the busy rush of a college session,
would have been altered and recast.
</p>

<p>
While originality was one of Professor
Bateman's most marked qualities, the members
of the committee entrusted with the
preparation of this volume for the press have not,
in every case, regarded originality of thought
as a necessary qualification for inclusion.
In making their selection they have rather
been guided by the desire to give to his
friends and old students what, whether original
in thought or not, appeared to be in treatment
and presentation most characteristic of the
man and teacher.
</p>

<p>
War&mdash;and herein lies its greatest tragedy&mdash;always
takes heavy toll of the promise and
latent greatness of a nation, its youth and
vigorous young manhood.  Like many others
who risked all and gave all in the Great War,
Reginald Bateman was cut off in his prime.
</p>

<p>
He was born in Ireland some thirty-eight
years ago.  His schooldays were spent under
Dr. Biggs, often called the Irish Arnold, at
Portora Royal School, perhaps the greatest
of Irish public schools, with a tradition of
scholarship which is centuries old.  On leaving
school he entered Trinity College, Dublin,
where he graduated with the Highest Honours
in Modern Literature.  In college his activities
and interests were wide, and he was an
outstanding example of the student who combines
with distinction in scholarship, prominence in
athletics and a broad and human outlook on
life.  In this as in other respects he was a
worthy representative of the spirit of his
University.  After a few years' experience of
teaching in Ireland, he was appointed to the
chair of English at the University of Saskatchewan,
being one of the original four professors
who, with President Murray, launched the
University on its educational career in 1909.
When a peaceful and unsuspecting world
was plunged, in August 1914, into the horrors
of the most stupendous war in its history,
Professor Bateman quickly decided that his
place was in the fighting line, and he enlisted
in the 28th Battalion in September 1914, in
company with another professor and many
members of our student body.  His ability
to handle men, quickly became apparent; he
soon won his sergeant's stripes, and went to
France with that rank.  In 1916 he was
recalled to Canada to take command of
the Saskatchewan Company of the Western
Universities' Battalion.  He proceeded to
England with the rank of major, and in 1917
reverted to the rank of lieutenant in order
to get again to France, where he was wounded
in action.  He was holding the rank of captain
in the 46th Battalion when he was killed on
the 3rd of September 1918.  He had taken
part in the fighting toward the end of August
when the Canadians made the first breach in
the Hindenburg Line.  The major of his
battalion has written that on the and of
September Captain Bateman gallantly led his
company into action. Dury was taken that
day, and near that place on the night of
September 3rd he was killed by a shell at the
Regimental Headquarters, which were being
held in a chalk quarry. On the 4th of
September the chaplain of the regiment gathered
together a party who, "amid the roar of
guns and scream of shells paid their last
respects to a very gallant comrade and one
of the best loved men in the Battalion."
</p>

<p>
Those who served under him as an officer
bear witness that he had won not only the
men's implicit confidence by qualities of
leadership of the highest order, but also their
very great affection by his personal qualities.
The affection and respect which were the
University's tribute to his character were
also the tribute of his comrades in
circumstances where a man's soul is stripped of all
pretences in the constant presence of death,
and where the dread arbitrament of war must
reveal the good or evil that may lie hidden
beneath the conventionalities of ordinary life.
Strong in body and fearless in spirit,
Reginald Bateman possessed that courage
which is neither the product of discipline
and rigorous training, nor the mere animal
quality which (to quote an early writer on
the war) "is our inheritance from a past in
which men fought each one for himself that
they might survive," but that finer quality
of courage which will face the most appalling
horrors because it has a vision of the future
and a faith in the destiny of mankind.
</p>

<p>
If Professor Bateman had survived, his
career as a soldier would have been but a
glorious interlude in his life's work. During
the years spent by him at the University, his
character and attainments had made him an
outstanding figure, and gave promise of a
future even richer in achievement. Intellectually,
he was a signal example of the union
of great ability and imagination with the
modesty of a fine spirit and a sane and
penetrating outlook on life. He was possessed of a
breadth of outlook that gave him clear insight
in literary matters. His judgments were
always just, because based on essentials,
while his humanity enabled him to couple
with the minutiae of scholarship a catholicity
of interpretation and a sanity of criticism
which is not always found in those who are
most deeply versed in their subject. The
respect of his colleagues and of his students
is definite proof of his great ability as a teacher.
It was manifest to all that he gave himself
wholeheartedly to his work with that
enjoyment and appreciation which are essential
characteristics of a true teacher.
</p>

<p>
The loss that the University in general has
sustained by Professor Bateman's death finds
its counterpart in the personal sorrow of his
friends.  Those who were privileged to know
him well are left immeasurably poorer by his
death but enriched by a memory that will
always remain with them.  For "his story
lives on woven into the stuff of other men's
lives."  His wide human interests brought
him into sympathetic touch with many phases
of life and gave him strength and tolerance.
His true manliness, sincerity of character,
and sociable nature endeared him to all.
He was a delightful comrade, and many of
his colleagues must remember some flash of
true humour which lit up the prosaic tenor
of an ordinary conversation or of some
inordinately dull Faculty Meeting.  The students
of the University too shared in his friendship.
His never-flagging interest in their activities,
whether literary, musical, or athletic, will
always be remembered.
</p>

<p>
The University of Saskatchewan lost in
the Great War many of its finest spirits, and
its losses reached their culmination in the
death of Reginald Bateman.

<h3>
FRANCIS THOMPSON
</h3>

<p class="t3">
<i>A paper given before the Faculty Club in 1913</i>
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The recent publication, April 1913, of the first
collected edition of Francis Thompson's works,
followed in August by an authentic biography of the
poet, has focussed general attention upon the man and
his work.  Hitherto, if known to the general reader
at all, he has been known mainly by one poem,
<i>The Hound of Heaven</i>, and the majority of the
reading public has not yet discovered that Thompson
is the author of a large body of poetry fully worthy
to rank with <i>The Hound of Heaven</i> in poetical
quality.  Even to the few who are familiar with his
poetry, the story of his life, one of the most romantic
in the annals of our literature, came as a revelation.
</p>

<p>
To the inner circle of literary people Thompson
as a poet has been known for twenty years.  With
his first volume of poems, published 1893, Thompson,
as one admirer expressed it, "reached the peak of
Parnassus at a bound."  The critics, usually so
conservative in their estimate of a new poet, were not
only favourable, but in most cases so far forgot
themselves as to become enthusiastic.  For parallels to
the austere passion and purity of Thompson's
love-poetry, to the richness and strangeness of his imagery,
the splendour and luxuriance of his vocabulary, and
the loftiness of his inspiration, they turned without
apology to the greatest names of our literature.
</p>

<p>
From this unusually favourable first opinion there
was naturally a reaction.  Thompson's second volume
of 1895, <i>Sister Songs</i>, and still more his third
volume of 1897, <i>New Poems</i>, with its increased
symbolism and mysticism, met with vicious abuse
as well as generous praise.  By 1907, however, the
date of Thompson's death, his reputation was well
established, and from that time to the present, the
tide of criticism seems to have set strongly in his
favour.  To-day few critics would deny him to be
the most remarkable of recent poets.
</p>

<p>
A fresh wave of interest was aroused last year when
the complete and final edition of his works was
published.  This reawakened interest is likely to have
the effect of passing his merit again under review,
and we shall have some opportunity of judging
whether he is to fade from the sight of men like a
brilliant but unlasting meteor, whether he is to be
like Keats and Shelley, the chosen poet of a small
and select circle of readers, or whether, like Tennyson
and Browning, he is to win the suffrages of the man
on the street.
</p>

<p>
Personally, while I believe that Thompson will
ultimately take a place among the greatest of our
nineteenth century poets, I think it extremely
unlikely that he will ever be popular.  The atmosphere
he lives in is too rare for the ordinary man to breathe
with comfort.  His emotions are too subtle, his
passion too austere, his harmonies too refined to
catch the ear of the crowd.  A few of his poems,
like <i>The Hound of Heaven</i>, which is already widely
known, may become popular, but I can recall no other
which seems to me likely to make an universal appeal.
</p>

<p>
Before passing to a sketch of Thompson's romantic
career, let me dwell for a short while on the more
striking qualities of his genius.  My first impressions
of Thompson have to do more with style than with
subject matter.  To the literary critic making the
acquaintance of a new poet it matters less, perhaps,
what the poet says than how he says it.  Harmony,
rhythm, language, technique&mdash;these things are of
vital importance.  It is true that we may often desire
of our poets "more matter and less art," but on the
other hand matter without art has never won the
name of great poetry.  There is a largeness and
finality of utterance, an appearance of inevitability
about the best work of the great masters, that is
unmistakable.  It is as if the Muse of Poetry herself
had spoken and not a mere mortal man.
</p>

<p class="poem">
Last came and last did go<br />
The Pilot of the Galilean lake.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Such words as these grow not upon mortal soil.
</p>

<p>
What one looks for, then, first of all in a new poet
is the grand style, the authentic note, the phrases
stamped with the tool of the eternal graver.  In the
search for it, one's only guide is instinct, an instinct
formed by constant study of what is admittedly the
best.  And the search for this distinction of style is
doomed so often to be disappointed that even a line
or a phrase which seems to possess it is gladly
welcomed.
</p>

<p>
But in Thompson's case the inspiration is not
confined to occasional flashes.  No matter where I
opened his book, almost every line seemed to me to
bear the hall-mark of great poetry.  Take even the
six lines of the dedication of <i>New Poems</i> to Coventry
Patmore; you find, I think, that they ring true,
that they have the great utterance.
</p>

<p class="poem">
Lo, my book thinks to look Time's leaguer down,<br />
Under the banner of your spread renown!<br />
Or if these levies of impuissant rhyme<br />
Fall to the overthrow of assaulting Time,<br />
Yet this one page shall find oblivious shame,<br />
Armed with your crested and prevailing Name.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In reading Thompson's poems one has neither, as
in the case of most moderns, to adjust oneself to a
completely new and perhaps freakish style, nor to
reconcile oneself to a more or less obvious imitation
of our greatest recent poets.  Thompson is not at
all modern; to one familiar with seventeenth
century English literature he comes like an old friend;
and yet he is no imitator; he is absolutely individual.
If a student of literature were given the poems
without being told the author, he would probably get
the impression that some forgotten poet of the
seventeenth century had been re-discovered.  For
Thompson's poems do not smack of the nineteenth
century; they have few echoes of Tennyson or
Browning or Swinburne or any nineteenth century
poet except, perhaps, Shelley; they have rather a
strong flavour of our elder poetry, and while rich,
perhaps over-rich, in imagery, give one an impression
of close-knit, sinewy strength very different from the
milk-and-watery mildness or the sensuous lusciousness
of much modern verse.  This effect is enhanced
by their vocabulary, which contains many words
strange to the modern ear, and which takes one back
to Sir Thomas Browne, Milton, Cowley, and Crashaw.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Ode to the Setting Sun</i> and the <i>Anthem of Earth</i>
illustrate to some extent another very prominent
characteristic of Thompson, that he is a daring and
successful experimenter in metre and language.  He
does not follow slavishly in the beaten track of other
poets; he frames metrical moulds for himself to suit
the quality of his own glowing thought.  The poems
are full of new and difficult metres, handled with
perfect mastery; they are full of experiments with
language which most modern poets would not dare
to make, but which in Thompson nearly always seem
to justify themselves.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most striking thing about Thompson's
poetry is the quality of his imagery.  A great poet
must be rich in imagery, for it is the imagery of poetry
that discloses to us its hidden soul.  Thompson's
imagery at once astonishes by its ingenuity and
captivates by its beauty.  In the former quality he
rivals Cowley and Crashaw, in the latter he is far
beyond them.  One critic remarked that Thompson
must surely be Crashaw born again, but born greater.
If Thompson's imagery has a fault, it is that there is
too much of it; he himself recognized this fault and
endeavoured to correct it.  Alice Meynell remarked
that many poets could be furnished with imagery,
not from the abundance of Thompson's, but from its
super-abundance.
</p>

<p>
Here are a few samples, chosen almost at random,
of the quality of Thompson's imagery:
</p>

<p class="poem">
And now my heart is as a broken fount,<br />
Wherein tear-drippings stagnate, spilt down ever<br />
From the dank thoughts that shiver<br />
Upon the sighful branches of my mind.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Under my ruined passions fallen and sere<br />
The wild dreams stir, like little radiant girls,<br />
Whom in the moulted plumage of the year,<br />
Their comrades sweet have buried to the curls.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
In a more commonplace style of imagery, but still
splendidly handled, is the following from <i>Sister
Songs</i>:
</p>

<p class="poem">
Or may this treasure-galleon of my verse,<br />
Fraught with its golden passion, oared with cadent rhyme,<br />
Set with a towering press of fantasies,<br />
Drop safely down the time,<br />
Leaving mine isled self behind it far,<br />
Soon to be sunken in the abysm of seas,<br />
(As down the years the splendour voyages<br />
From some long-ruined and night-submerged star).<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The foregoing extracts impress one also with
another noteworthy and very important quality of
Thompson's verse&mdash;its remarkable metrical effects.
Watts-Dunton rightly says that in addition to
intellectual and emotional life, great poetry must
have rhythmic life.  Unless the rhythm of any metrical
passage is so vivid, so natural, and so free that it
seems as though it could live, if need were, by its
rhythm alone, that passage, according to
Watts-Dunton, has no right to exist as poetry.  One sign
by which one may know that poetry possesses
rhythmic life is that passages of it will sing themselves
in one's head for days after reading them.  Arnold
Bennett tells us that after reading <i>Sister Songs</i> he
went about for days repeating such passages as:
</p>

<p class="poem">
The innocent moon, that nothing does but shine,<br />
Moves all the labouring surges of the world.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
After reading Thompson first, I went about for days
repeating over and over again passages from his
poems, not for their meaning, for the meaning in
many cases was not clear, but just for the sound and
beat of them, such passages as:
</p>

<p class="poem">
On Ararat there grew a vine...<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
or
</p>

<p class="poem">
I am Daniel's mystic mountain...<br />
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>
Everyone knows Kipling's picture of sunrise in
<i>Mandalay</i>:
</p>

<p class="poem">
An' the dawn comes up like thunder outer China 'crost the Bay.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
This is commonplace beside Thompson's version of
the same thought in <i>The Mistress of Vision</i>:
</p>

<p class="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East, ah, east of Himalay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwell the nations underground;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiding from the shock of Day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sun's uprising sound:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dare not issue from the ground<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the tumults of the Day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So fearfully the sun doth sound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clanging up beyond Cathay,<br />
For the great earth-quaking sunrise rolling up beyond Cathay.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Lastly, Thompson's poetry impresses one with a
sense of sublimity, in the strict, literal meaning of the
word, which is <i>upliftedness</i>.  Thompson seems always
uplifted to a high level of inspiration; his wing
seems never to flag nor his voice to tire.  The reason
for this consistent loftiness of Thompson's poetry
is probably that to Thompson the writing of poetry
was an act of worship, and that the main spring of
his inspiration is religious enthusiasm.  He never
wrote except when he felt that he must write.  He
was only, he says, the conduit-pipe through which
flowed the divine utterance.  Speaking of poets he
says:
</p>

<p class="poem">
We speak a lesson taught we know not how,<br />
And what it is that from us flows<br />
The hearer better than the utterer knows.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In every line of Thompson's verse one finds
evidence of "the vision and the faculty divine,"
and when after his brief period of song that vision
faded and that faculty failed, he wrote no more.
Thompson wrote because he must write.  Like Keats
he was haunted perpetually by an image of the ideal
Beauty, to which he was ever striving to attain.
Poetry sometimes seems to him his curse, and not
his blessing.

<p>
Francis Thompson was accustomed to crest all his
manuscripts with the sign of the cross; and just as
all his verse may be said to have been written under
the inspiration of the cross, so his life may be said
to have been lived under its shadow.  The Hand that
wrought out his destiny must have placed over its
finished work the sign of mingled shame and glory,
of suffering and triumph.  Life was too strong for
Thompson; it crushed him beneath its hurrying
feet; it stunned him with its tumults; it withheld
from him the love for which his soul craved; but
out of the defeat of his life rose the triumph of his
verse.
</p>

<p>
It seems that Thompson sank to the lowest depths
of life's misery that he might rise to its highest
pinnacle of inspiration.  It was when pitiless London
had almost crushed the life out of him, and when his
eyes were blinded with pain to the things around him,
that the heavenly vision was clearest.  On the day
when he, "poor thief of song," was nailed to his
bitterest cross, he heard most clearly a voice saying,
"To-day thou shalt be with me in Paradise."
</p>

<p>
It was in recollection of some such mood,
experienced as an outcast on the London streets,
that he wrote the verses, <i>The Kingdom of God</i>, found
in manuscript among his papers after his death,
which illustrate as well as any other single poem the
extraordinary inter-blending of the seen and the
unseen in his poetry.  His own words about Shelley
apply with equal force to himself: "He stood at the
very junction lines of the visible and invisible, and
could shift the points as he willed."
</p>

<p>
Francis Thompson was born at Preston, Lancashire,
in 1859, the son of Charles Thompson, a doctor,
afterwards in practice at Ashton-under-Lyne.  His
literary genius cannot be explained on any theory of
heredity.  The fact that his father seemed absolutely
(and almost culpably) blind to his son's artistic nature
seems to me to account in large measure for the
tragedy of Thompson's youth.  Later, when the son
became famous, no one was more surprised than
Charles Thompson, but though the success of his
son's poetry must have touched his pride, it did not
penetrate to his intellect, for he confessed that he
was quite unable to understand it.  We must, then,
acquit Charles Thompson of having any act or part
in his son's literary attainments; and from all
accounts, his mother was equally innocent of literary
talent.
</p>

<p>
But, though the poet owed none of his genius to his
parents, he owed them something more important,
something which proved to be the very life-spring
of that genius, namely, his religious enthusiasm.
Thompson is first and last a religious poet.  In him
and his contemporary, Patmore, Roman Catholicism,
which had for centuries, almost, in fact, since the
days of Dante, relinquished to poets of other faiths
the chief glories of song, found a voice.  The mysteries
of religion were Thompson's chief inspiration, the
interpretation of them his highest task.  His father
and mother, and the majority of his uncles and aunts
were converts to the Roman Catholic Church; but
whereas their spirit of worship was dumb, in
Thompson all that is best in Roman Catholicism is
glorified in shining verse.
</p>

<p>
Thompson, however, is not a sectarian poet.  He is
too great for that.  It is the spirit of universal religion
that breathes in his verse.  The poetry of the
Victorian era, which for many years had been groping
after religious faith, found with Thompson the note
of absolute certainty.  "The people that walked in
darkness saw in him a great light."  "To be the
poet of the return to Patmore is somewhat," he said,
"but I would be the poet of the return to God."
</p>

<p>
Thompson, a sensitive, delicate child, was brought
up with his two sisters, and seems to have been
remarkable in childhood chiefly for his gentleness and
capacity for make-believe.  At the age of eleven he
left the shelter of his home for Ushaw, a Roman
Catholic college near Durham, where he endured at
first the same miseries as fall to the lot of most
high-strung, sensitive boys, when exposed to the brutalities
of a large English boarding school.  His was the fate
of Cowper and Shelley, and in Thompson's <i>Essay on
Shelley</i>, which (leaving aside its magnificence as a
piece of prose writing) is valuable less for its comments
on Shelley than for the light which it throws on
Thompson himself, the remarks on the persecution
endured at school by Shelley are suggested by
Thompson's own experiences.  Probably none of
either Thompson's teachers or schoolfellows perceived
in him the tokens of future greatness.  He passed
through his school-days, as in the main he passed
through life, with his true self hidden from all
observers under an impenetrable reserve.
</p>

<p>
Thompson's father intended him for the priesthood,
and to that end his studies were directed during the
whole seven years of his stay at Ushaw.  Probably
the training he received, particularly his study of the
Missal and hymns of the Church, had no small
effect upon his later verse.  Though he took a high
place in his literary classes, particularly in English,
and though his teachers thought highly of his ability,
they became gradually convinced that his nervous
timidity and constitutional indolence rendered him
unfit for the priesthood.  The principal of the college
wrote to that effect to his father in 1877, while at
the same time expressing his belief that if Thompson
could shake off his natural indolence he had ability
to succeed in any career.
</p>

<p>
Thompson therefore returned home in 1877, to the
great disappointment of his parents.  The indolence
which proved his undoing was, says his biographer,
Everard Meynell, only "one name of many for the
abstractions of Thompson's mind and the inactivities
of his body."  Against this indolence he struggled
nobly all his life.  Not a lifetime of mornings
spent in bed killed his desire to be up and doing.
Even in the trembling hand of his last months he
wrote out in big capitals on pages torn from exercise
books such texts as were calculated to frighten him
into his clothes.  In the morning when he woke his
eyes fell upon such words as these, "Thou wilt not he
abed when the last trump blows," "Thy sleep with
the worms will be long enough," and so on, but all in
vain.  Thompson's indolence was not a mental but a
physical characteristic.  His poor, disordered body
refused exertion and was too sluggish for all Thompson's
spiritual energy to rouse.  Apparently, however,
this indolence and absence of mind would have
caused Thompson to fail in any regular profession,
and perhaps his father is as much to be pitied as
blamed for his next strenuous attempt to make
Francis capable of earning his own livelihood.
</p>

<p>
After Thompson's failure at Ushaw, his father
decided to prepare his son for his own profession,
and sent him to take a medical course at Owen's
College, Manchester.  For the following six years
Thompson pretended to study medicine.  He made
the journey from home to lectures every morning
under compulsion, but once out of sight of the parental
eye his day was his own, and was spent anywhere
rather than at the lecture or in the dissecting room.
He wandered about Manchester, an untidy, abstracted
figure with trailing shoe-laces and careless dress,
indifferent to passers-by, and muttering a continual
soliloquy.  He haunted the libraries, museums, and
galleries of the city, and while his father thought
his son was preparing himself to earn a competence
as a respectable practising physician, the son was
really equipping himself all unconsciously for the
career which was to win him, not indeed a competence,
but an undying name in English poetry.  It was at
this time, in poring over our sixteenth and seventeenth
century writers, that Thompson acquired his
wonderful vocabulary, which contains so many forgotten
words that the critics later accused him of wholesale
coinage, and which gives his verse that rich flavour
of antiquity which is no small part of its charm.
</p>

<p>
At this time, too, Thompson made the acquaintance
of De Quincey, "his very own De Quincey," a writer
to whose career Thompson's in many respects bears
an extraordinary resemblance.  De Quincey naturally
drew his attention to opium, with disastrous results.
Opium-eating was in the air of Manchester, the
cotton-spinners being much addicted to its use, and
Thompson became a victim.  With a short interval
he was a user of opium to the end of his days.  It is
difficult to estimate the effect of the drug habit on
Thompson's writings; personally, I doubt that it had
any effect.  It certainly had no direct effect, for we
have his own solemn assurance that none of his
published verse (except one poem, <i>The Dream Tryst</i>)
was written under its influence.  In fact, his first
outburst of poetry came apparently as a result of
his temporary breaking-off of the drug habit, after he
had been rescued from the London streets; and during
the few years of his poetic productiveness he seems
to have freed himself from the influence of opium.
Thompson thought too highly of poetry and of his
mission as a poet to use opium as a stimulus to
verse-making.  In the latter years of his life he went
back again to the drug as a relief from incessant
physical weakness and misery, and who that has not
suffered equally can blame him?
</p>

<p>
But though opium affected Thompson's genius
little, if at all, it certainly affected his character,
and made whatever was weak and slack, weaker and
slacker.  He proved a complete failure at Owen's
College, and was given a trial at Glasgow with similar
results.  His father was in despair.  Hundreds of
pounds from his scanty income had been spent for
lectures to which his son had not listened, for the
fees of examiners who got no papers to examine,
and for courses in dissection during which Francis
had not been once to the dissecting table.  Opium,
however, cannot be blamed for Thompson's failure;
he must have failed anyway; it only made his failure
more complete and hopeless.  On the other hand,
it had undoubtedly in one way a beneficial physical
effect.  On this subject his biographer remarks: "It
staved off the assaults of tuberculosis; it gave him
the wavering strength that made life just possible for
him, whether on the streets, or through all those other
distresses and discomforts that it was his character
deeply to resent, but not to remove by any normal
courses."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Thompson took Francis away from college
and next set him to work with a surgical instrument
maker.  There he remained two weeks.  His next
attempt at work was as agent for a new encyclopaedia.
This book it took him two months to read through,
and he did not sell a single copy.  His father then
told him that he must enlist.  Thompson obeyed
without a word.  He was rejected as physically unfit,
but not before he had gone through a weary period
of marching and drill in the endeavour to expand
his chest to the necessary inches.  Thompson once
more returned home, as he did from each successive
failure, saying simply, "I have not succeeded,"
and vouchsafing no explanation.  There were
apparently no confidences between Thompson and his
father; Dr. Thompson knew nothing of his son's
literary ambitions.  His comment when later he
found his son welcomed as a poet was: "If the lad
had but told me!" but it is doubtful, as Mr. Mills
says, "that the worthy doctor regarded the greenest
of poetic laurels as a fair exchange for a thriving
medical practice."
</p>

<p>
This time Thompson's reception seems to have
been unusually chilling, and in a hopeless mood he
left home without saying good-bye, and started for
London with no money but his fare, and with no
baggage but a volume of Blake in one pocket and
Aeschylus in another.  Friendless, incompetent,
aimless, he threw himself into the maw of the great
city which has devoured so many poets, and soon
plumbed the very depths of poverty and despair.
For three years he drifted about London, sinking
continually lower, and the astonishing thing is that
he came through the ordeal alive.
</p>

<p>
His feeble attempts at finding and doing "work"
soon ceased, and then he knew what it meant to walk
in rags and herd with the outcasts of the street, to
sleep in a fourpenny doss-house, or, if he had no
money, on the Embankment, to suffer hunger and
pain and cold.  An attempt to establish himself as
a boot-black met with the usual ill-success that
attended all Thompson's practical efforts, and the
time came when, for a week, his only earning was
sixpence for holding a horse's head.  Later still,
he was on the streets day and night successively for
fifteen days, and sank into a kind of stupor, moving
about in a sort of half-consciousness as in a walking
nightmare.
</p>

<p>
From this pitiable state he was rescued temporarily
by a Mr. McMaster, a pious and kindly boot-maker
who made a practice of assisting such unfortunates.
He had designs on Thompson's soul, but when
Thompson, even in his destitute condition, refused
to allow his soul to be tampered with, McMaster
wisely concluded that the next best thing was to
save Thompson's body; and he did so.  Thompson
was taken into the shop, and proving hopeless at
boot-making, was made errand-boy at five shillings
a week.  Here he got a chance to write, and covered
the bootmaker's discarded account books with prose
and poetry; and, according to McMaster, even
submitted manuscripts to several magazines, but
apparently without success.
</p>

<p>
Opium, the effects of which were mistaken by
McMaster for those of drink, lost Thompson this
situation, and he was again thrown on the streets
to sink even lower than before.  It was at this time
that he received the indelible impressions of the
London streets which he recorded years after in his
review of General Booth's <i>Darkest England</i>: "A
region whose hedgerows have set to brick, whose
soil is chilled to stone; where flowers are sold and
women; where the men wither and the stars; whose
streets to me on the most glittering day are black.
For I unveil their secret meanings.  I read their
human hieroglyphs.  I diagnose from a hundred
occult signs the disease which perturbs their populous
pulses.  Misery cries out to me from the kerb-stone;
despair passes me by in the ways; I discern limbs
laden with fetters impalpable but not imponderable;
I hear the shaking of invisible lashes; I see men
dabbled with their own oozing life."
</p>

<p>
It was at this time that Thompson, like De Quincey,
was befriended by a girl of the streets, who noticed
his forlorn condition and whose motherly instincts
were roused by his helplessness.  "Weakness and
confidence, humility and reverence, were gifts
unknown to her except at his hands, and she repaid
them with graces as lovely as a child's, and as
unhesitating as a saint's."  When Thompson was finally
rescued by Wilfrid Meynell, she fled from him,
fearing that his friendship with her might prejudice
his chances of better things.  "They will not
understand our friendship," she said, and then, "I always
knew you were a genius."  She changed her lodgings
and Thompson sought her in vain.
</p>

<p>
In <i>Sister Songs</i>, in a passage addressed to Sylvia
(that is, little Madeline Meynell) he pays a beautiful
tribute to the childishness of this girl.
</p>

<p class="poem">
Once&mdash;in that nightmare-time which still doth haunt<br />

<span style="letter-spacing: 3em">*****</span><br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In February 1887 came the crisis of Thompson's
fate.  At that time Thompson scraped together a few
shillings somehow and began to decipher and put
together the half-obliterated manuscript of his
article on <i>Paganism, Old and New</i>, written, I suppose,
at McMaster's.  "I came simultaneously to my last
page and my last halfpenny," says Thompson, "and
went forth to drop the manuscript in the letter-box
of the Catholic magazine, <i>Merrie England</i>.  Next day
I spent the halfpenny on two boxes of matches and
began the struggle for life."
</p>

<p>
Among all the important letters that have been
posted since man became a letter-writing animal, that
letter of Thompson's to the editor of <i>Merrie England</i>
holds, it seems to me, a prominent place.  One
trembles to think what might have happened if that
manuscript had never reached the editor or been
overlooked by him.  In all probability Thompson
would have died of starvation in the streets of London,
and a poet who may prove to be one of the first in our
literature would have gone "mute and inglorious" to
an outcast's grave.  But though it lay pigeon-holed
for six months without receiving the attention of a
busy editor, in due course the letter and
accompanying manuscript were read.
</p>

<p>
To no better man could Thompson have appealed
than the editor of <i>Merrie England</i>, Wilfrid Meynell,
a man whose hand was ever stretched out to help the
unfortunate.  At present, however, he knew nothing
of Thompson except that his essay showed a
master-hand.  After some difficulty Meynell managed to get
into communication with the author through a
druggist to whom Thompson owed money for opium, and
many days after, Mr. Meynell, in his workroom, was
told that Mr. Thompson wished to see him.  "Show
him up," he said, and was left alone.  What follows
is told in the words of Everard Meynell:
</p>

<p>
"Then the door opened and a strange hand was
thrust in.  The door closed but Thompson had not
entered.  Again it opened, again it shut.  At the
third attempt, a very waif of a man came in.  No such
figure had been looked for; more ragged and unkempt
than the average beggar, with no shirt beneath his
coat, and bare feet in broken shoes, he found my
father at a loss for words."
</p>

<p>
Wilfrid Meynell then, with immense patience and
kindness, set about the task of rescuing Thompson.
Thompson was not an easy man to rescue.  Reserved
and secretive by habit, he made no confidences and
asked no favours.  He did not seem at first to realize
that salvation for him was possible, and that he could
earn his living by writing.  At any rate, it was only by
the exercise of considerable tact and patience that
Mr. Meynell succeeded in obtaining any of his confidence.
</p>

<p>
Physically, Thompson had suffered severely in his
long struggle with starvation.  "He will not live,"
was the doctor's verdict, "and you hasten his death
by denying his whims and opium."  Meynell, however,
took the risk and sent Thompson to a private hospital.
</p>

<p>
The experiment succeeded.  Thompson secured a
fresh lease of life, and, for the time, renounced opium.
All lovers of literature owe a debt of gratitude to
Meynell for his astonishing kindness and unselfishness
towards Thompson at this time and to the end of the
poet's life.  Few would have taken the trouble, amid
the cares of a busy life, to look after Thompson,
who in many ways was as incapable of managing
his own affairs as a child.  Meynell found him work,
and for the remaining years of his life Thompson
secured a scanty living by his pen.  His poetry
brought him little, but review work and occasional
articles for such magazines as the <i>Athenæum</i> gave him
generally enough to live on, and anything that was
lacking was supplied by Meynell.
</p>

<p>
Soon after Thompson's rescue comes the extraordinary
spectacle of the outburst of his poetic talent.
Here was a man of letters of the first rank whose
genius had blossomed fresh and fair from the filth of
the London streets.  His long proximity with vice
and degradation of the worst kind had not cast
even a shadow on the purity of Thompson's spirit;
and his poetry rose from the slums of London as
stainless as Venus from the ocean.
</p>

<p>
The Meynells furnished Thompson with much of
his poetic inspiration.  Meynell had introduced
Thompson to his own family.  His wife, Alice Meynell,
the poetess, became the saint of Thompson's adoration,
two of the children, Monica and Madeline, were
revelations to him of the beauty of girlhood; and he
repaid the sheltering care and attention shown him
by the family by conferring on them all he had to give,
the best fruits of his genius.
</p>

<p>
To Mrs. Meynell he addressed the beautiful poems
of his first volume, entitled <i>Love in Dian's Lap</i>; to
Monica Meynell several of the best poems in that
volume; and to Monica and Madeline his second
volume entitled <i>Sister Songs</i>.  His affection for Wilfrid
Meynell is expressed in a few lines entitled <i>To W. M.</i>
</p>

<p class="poem">
O Tree of many branches!  One thou hast<br />
Thou barest not, but graftedst on thee.  Now<br />
Should all men's thunders break on thee, and leave<br />
Thee reft of bough and blossom, that one branch<br />
Shall cling to thee, my Father, Brother, Friend,<br />
Shall cling to thee unto the end of end.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Thompson's verses were all he had to give in return
for the Meynells' kindness, and to my mind they were
a rich recompense for the continual trouble, anxiety,
and petty annoyances which he dealt out to his
friends with lavish hands.
</p>

<p>
In the ordinary intercourse and business of daily
life, Francis Thompson was not only deficient, he
was impossible.  The practice of the elementary
habits of order and method, which to other men are
the necessities and commonplaces of daily life, was
to Thompson an insurmountable difficulty.  His life
is one long record of broken promises, unkept
appointments, and other trials of the patience and tempers
of all who had to do with him.  He would keep an
appointment anywhere from an hour or more to
two or three days late, and be full of contrition,
excuses, and explanations.  The inherent sweetness
and loveableness of the man atoned for much, but
still we cannot but praise the Meynells for their
unwavering kindness to this difficult genius.  Wilfrid
Meynell had to act continually as a buffer between
Thompson and irate landladies, impatient editors,
exasperated publishers, and disappointed interviewers.
He had to see that the poet's rent was paid, and that
he had the wherewithal to clothe and feed himself.
</p>

<p>
Thompson's incurable shabbiness and eccentricities
made it difficult to introduce him into polite society,
even if he had been capable of arriving in time for
any social function; and though a brilliant talker
when <i>tête-à-tête</i> with a sympathetic listener, in
ordinary conversation he was more remarkable for
the futility of his endless repetitions than for anything
else.  And yet he was never uncouth or awkward.
His manners were gentle; his speech was that of a
polished gentleman; his worn face could light up
with beautiful ardour, and his frail body never lost
its essential dignity.  His laugh, too, was always ready
at the slightest pleasantry.
</p>

<p>
He made a wildly picturesque figure as he wandered
through the London streets in these latter days,
generally completely unconscious of his surroundings,
and with a continual muttered soliloquy.  With his
old brown cape, which he wore in the hottest weather,
"his disastrous hat," his old satchel for review books
slung over his shoulder, and his wild worn face, he
looked like some picturesque pedlar who had just
stepped out of a romance of the Middle Ages.  In all
the countless times that Everard Meynell met Thompson
in the streets of London he never once surprised
him in a conscious moment.  That Thompson ever
took the right turning or found his way home safely
is a fact for which his friends could offer no adequate
explanation.  Mr. Lewis Hind, editor of <i>The Academy</i>
while Thompson was a contributor, says: "In memory
I see him one miserable November afternoon,
communing with the Seraphim and frolicking with the
young-eyed Cherubim in Chancery Lane.  The roads
were ankle-deep in slush; a thin icy rain was falling;
the yellow fog enwrapped the pedestrians squelching
down the lane, and going through them in a narrow
path, I saw Francis Thompson, wet and
mud-spattered.  But he was not unhappy.  What is a
day of unpleasant weather to one who lives in
eternity?  His lips were moving, his head was raised,
for above the roof of the Chancery Lane Safe Deposit
Company, in the murk of the fog, he saw beatific
visions."
</p>

<p>
Thompson's affection for his few friends was perhaps
the brightest spot in this latter part of his life.
For the rest, the record of it is mainly one of loneliness
and poverty.  He ate at poor tables of boarding-house
or restaurant fare, he lived in comfortless
rooms rendered more comfortless still by his
untidiness, he had no possessions, not even books.  All
that he left at his death was a tin box of rubbish,
"pipes that would not draw, pens that would not
write, unopened letters, a lamp without a wick."
</p>

<p>
It would not be right to regard Thompson as an
entirely unhappy man.  I should think his hours of
joy were at least as many as his hours of sorrow, and
as intense.  One observer speaks of him thus: "He
gave me the impression of concealing within him two
inexhaustible reservoirs of sorrow and joy; ebullitions
from each appear in his poetry; but in his talks with
me he rarely drew except from the fountain of joy."  He
practised in his life the "stark doctrine of
renunciation" which alone can lead man to the higher
levels of inspiration, and which he has stated for us in
<i>The Mistress of Vision</i>.  In this poem the "Land of
Luthany" represents for Thompson the poet's
supreme vision.
</p>

<p>
Thompson's worst trial was not being able to write
poetry.  For the last six years the consolations of
poetry, as well as the pains of poetry, were denied
him.  After the volume of 1897 his Muse deserted
him, and he would not sing without inspiration.
With the exception of a few occasional pieces, he
wrote, in these later years, nothing but prose, prose
as fine in its way as his poetry.
</p>

<p>
In November 1907 Thompson's rare spirit was
set free from the fetters of his worthless body.  "He
left to those who loved him," said Meynell, "the
memory of an unique personality and to English
poetry an imperishable name."
</p>

<p>
I shall conclude with a very brief review of
Thompson's work.  Francis Thompson's writings are
not remarkable for their bulk.  Three fair-sized
volumes hold them all.  What is remarkable about
them is the consistently high quality of both prose
and poetry; they both possess the stamp of distinction,
the master-touch, the great utterance.
</p>

<p>
Of the prose perhaps the finest thing is the Essay on
Shelley, but Thompson seemed incapable of writing
anything that was not fine.  Within certain limits
he seems to me to be a critic of the very highest
calibre.  A complete and sound literary theory could
be put together from his critical essays.
</p>

<p>
The poetry was published in three volumes during
Thompson's lifetime.  We saw that it was the first
volume of 1893 that took the literary world by storm,
and justly so.  It is nearly all magnificent.  Besides
<i>The Hound of Heaven</i>, by general consent the greatest
religious poem and one of the greatest odes in the
language, and <i>The Dead Cardinal of Westminster</i>, it
contains a series of love-poems of the very highest
quality addressed to Alice Meynell, some exquisite
verses on children, and many other gems.  Thompson's
love-poems are among the finest in our language,
but are not, of course, love-poems in the ordinary
sense of the word.  They express, as one critic said,
"a sort of sublimated enthusiasm for the beauty of
womanhood," and their enthusiasm was linked to
Thompson's religion by being for him an earthly type
of his adoration of the Virgin Mother, the crown and
pinnacle of idealized womanhood.
</p>

<p>
The second volume, published in 1895, consisted of
one long poem in two parts, <i>Sister Songs</i>, addressed
to the sisters Monica and Madeline Meynell.  The
first part seems to me to be spoiled by over-luxuriance,
but the second is grand poetry.  One short quotation
must suffice:
</p>

<p class="poem">
Eve no gentlier lays her cooling cheek<br />
On the burning brow of the sick earth,<br />
Sick with death, and sick with birth,<br />
Aeon to aeon, in secular fever twirled,<br />
Than thy shadow soothes this weak<br />
And distempered being of mine.<br />
In all I work, my hand includeth thine;<br />
Thou rushest down in every stream<br />
Whose passion frets my spirit's deepening gorge;<br />
Unhood'st mine eyas-heart, and fliest my dream;<br />
Thou swing'st the hammers of my forge!<br />
As the innocent moon, that nothing does but shine,<br />
Moves all the labouring surges of the world.<br />
Pierce where thou wilt the springing thought in me<br />
And there thy pictured countenance lies enfurled,<br />
As in the cut fern lies the imaged tree.<br />
This poor song that sings of thee,<br />
This fragile song, is but a curled<br />
Shell outgathered from thy sea,<br />
And murmurous still of its nativity.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Thompson's third and last volume was published
in 1897, under the title <i>New Poems</i>.  This volume
contains some of his longest and most elaborate
compositions.  Like many of the poems in Volume
One outside those already noticed, the most important
poems of Volume Three are expressions of Thompson's
religious mysticism, and with this is combined a free
use of symbolism derived from the Hebrew Prophets
and the Eastern mythologies.  Although no one can
fail to recognize the splendour of the poetry in this
third volume, a full appreciation of it requires a
somewhat special equipment.  "The main region of
Mr. Thompson's poetry," says Patmore, "is the
inexhaustible and hitherto almost unworked mine of
Catholic philosophy."  To one not specially versed
in that philosophy, an attempt to give an appreciation
of the poems is a dangerous task, and one full of
pitfalls.
</p>

<p>
Suffice it to say that Thompson's mysticism is not
an apparently aimless plunging about in the darkness
of the void like that of Maeterlinck and other modern
mystics.  Thompson's mysticism was kept within
bounds and given a definite direction by common
sense and the authority of the Church.  "Dante," he
said, "is a perfect rebuke to those who believe
that a mystical genius must be dissociated from
common sense.  Every such poet should be able to
give a clear and logical prose <i>résumé</i> of his teaching
as terse as a page of scholastic philosophy."  And
so we find that the rule of Thompson's practice is
summed up in the words, "To the Poet life is full of
visions, to the Mystic it is one vision."  Having
regarded the visions as a poet, and set them down as a
mystic, he would call them one.  The one great vision
enfolded and explained them all.  Such is the explanation
of his poems, <i>The Orient Ode</i>, <i>The Anthem of
Earth</i>, and <i>The Ode to the Setting Sun</i>.
</p>

<p>
To treat Thompson fairly one should give his
deeper poems careful study, but Thompson does not
always write of deep and doubtful things.  More often
indeed his faith is as the faith of a little child.  We are
told on high authority that we must become as little
children if we are to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
It was as a little child that Thompson sought to enter
there, and it is among the children of Heaven that
Thompson would take his place.
</p>

<p>
To his godchild he writes:
</p>

<p class="poem">
And when, immortal mortal, droops your head,<br />
And you, the child of deathless song, are dead;<br />
Then, as you search with unaccustomed glance<br />
The ranks of Paradise for my countenance,<br />
Turn not your tread along the Uranian sod<br />
Among the bearded counsellors of God;<br />
For if in Eden as on earth are we,<br />
I sure shall keep a younger company:<br />
Pass where beneath their rangéd gonfalons<br />
The starry cohorts shake their shielded suns,<br />
The dreadful mass of their enridgèd spears;<br />
Pass where majestical the eternal peers,<br />
The stately choice of the great Saintdom, meet&mdash;<br />
A silvern segregation, globed complete<br />
In sandalled shadow of the Triune feet;<br />
Pass by where wait, young poet-wayfarer,<br />
Your cousined clusters, emulous to share<br />
With you the roseal lightnings burning 'mid their hair;<br />
Pass the crystalline sea, the Lampads seven:&mdash;<br />
Look for me in the nurseries of Heaven.<br />

MILTON

<p class="t3">
AN UNDERGRADUATE POEM<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
From out the darkness of the vanished years,<br />
The voice of Milton peals; his mighty song<br />
Rings down the centuries, its note still strong<br />
As when it burst upon our fathers' ears.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Amid the unnumber'd harmonies that swell<br />
From bards of earth to break round heaven's throne,<br />
His part, clear heard amid the mingled tone,<br />
Rolls full and solemn, like a deep-voiced bell.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
A spirit strong with more than mortal strength,<br />
When in life's battle he had borne his share,<br />
He passed from out the tumult and the care,<br />
And climbed upon the mountain tops at length.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
There, with blind eyes turned to the Promised Land,<br />
Waiting the dawn of an unending day,<br />
His soul went forth in that tremendous lay<br />
The eternal heights and breadths and depths which spanned.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Poor, lonely and forgot, though he endured<br />
The bitter thought of labour spent in vain,<br />
And saw invaded by a godless train<br />
The land whose liberty he deemed assured;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Yet not for that did he "abate one jot<br />
Of heart or hope"; scorning to cringe or cower,<br />
Steadfast he stood like some majestic tower,<br />
That feels the tempest's blast, but wavers not.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
From rulers of the earth he asked no grace,<br />
Nor leaned upon the love of human heart,<br />
Lofty and passionless he drew apart,<br />
And communed with the Highest face to face.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Far from the din and toil of mortal kind<br />
His spirit's barque was borne; serene and high<br />
He brooded on the unfathomed mystery<br />
Of thoughts that burden the Eternal Mind.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
For Freedom he had stood, in her defence<br />
His best had given; where'er the fight was keen,<br />
Ever amid the foremost had he been<br />
Down-bearing tyranny's battalions dense.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
For that he left his ease and hopes of fame;<br />
Endured the heat and burden of the day;<br />
And while his lyre mute and forgotten lay,<br />
Laboured to clear from wrong his country's name.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
And now, that task fulfilled, his voice once more<br />
Breaks forth into a fuller, richer song,<br />
"Not changed to hoarse or mute," sublime and strong,<br />
The noblest heard among the sons of men.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
A strain full worthy of his subject high&mdash;<br />
Sin, Death, and Hell, and our eternal woe;<br />
The gloomy majesty of Heaven's great foe,<br />
Hurling defiance to the vaulted sky;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
The work of Christ, Immortal Son of God,<br />
The warring hosts of fiends to darkness hurl'd,<br />
Creation and the birth of this round world,<br />
And man brought low beneath th' Almighty rod.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
His throne is set where the immortals are,<br />
Where Dante, crowned with laurel, smiles serene,<br />

<h3>
THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH
</h3>

<p class="t3">
<i>Two Lectures given to the Class in Education<br />
in the University</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
LECTURE I
</p>

<p>
In this lecture I propose to tell you not how
English ought to be taught, but simply how I
teach English.  I know nothing of pedagogy; I have
never attended a Normal School; I have read very
few books on teaching in general, and only one on
the teaching of English in particular; I know nothing
of the methods which you yourselves are being taught
to employ.  I ask you, then, to take my lectures
simply as a personal document, a relation of what
I have gathered from my own experience.  Such a
document, if sincere, must be valuable, and I need,
I think, make no apology if I mention as discoveries
of my own, methods and principles which are, perhaps,
commonplaces with the educationalist.
</p>

<p>
In the matter of teaching every man must work
out his own salvation; I believe that he cannot take
his methods ready-made from another.  The method
which suits me and gets me the best result may not
suit you.  And so, though I believe that every teacher
of English ought to follow certain general principles
which I will try to lay down, I believe also that it
is a fatal mistake for any man to attempt to model
his way of teaching exactly upon that of another.
To-day, then, I propose simply to tell you of some
of the things which I discovered for myself, some
of the difficulties I met with, some of the faults which
I have overcome, or am still trying to overcome.
</p>

<p>
I see before myself still a long and weary road,
which must be travelled before I reach anything
approaching my ideal.  In fact, I hope, as every
teacher ought to hope, that I shall never reach a
point where I can say I am satisfied, for as sure as
I do, I shall know that I have ceased to make progress.
As long as a man struggles, he is advancing; when he
ceases to struggle, he has ceased to advance; and
when he ceases to advance, it is almost certain that
he has commenced to go backward.
</p>

<p>
For the purposes of this lecture I shall take the
teaching of English to mean the teaching of English
literature only.  I have had no experience of High
School work, and therefore my remarks refer to the
teaching of average University students of the first
or second year, very much the same sort of students
as you have to deal with in your High Schools.  The
methods I adopt with my Honour Classes differ
widely from those I use with pass students.
</p>

<p>
Before one attempts to describe his method of teaching,
he should make very clear his conception of the
object for which the subject is studied.  One may read
a piece of literature, for example, in many different
ways.  One may treat it as a piece of art, a record of
life, a truth that some fellow-man has seen in a
moment of clear-sightedness, has "snatched from
the eternal silence," and has set down that we may
see it too.  Again, one may read it with a view to its
structure, as an example of literary technique; or
one may treat it as an historical document, a reflection
of the spirit of the age which produced it; or, again,
as an exercise in philology, as material for the study
of words.  According as one object or another
predominates, so will the method of teaching change;
if one object is sought to the exclusion of all others,
the method of teaching will, of course, vary with
the object in view.  The philologist will subordinate
everything to the study of philology; the historian
will fasten all his attention on the evidences of date,
the local references, the flavour of contemporary
philosophy, politics, religion, or whatever it may be;
the technician will be entirely occupied with form,
metre, structure.
</p>

<p>
<i>Hamlet</i>, for example, may be treated as a work of
art, as the history of a man doomed to destruction
through an inherent and fatal flaw, a human soul
caught in the web of circumstance and tortured to
death; or it may be treated as a study in the language
of the Elizabethans; or as an example of the
stagecraft of Shakespeare; or even as material for
constructing ingenious cipher messages revealing the
fact that, as Shakespeare was utterly unable to write
plays for himself, Bacon kindly wrote them for him.
</p>

<p>
The first question which the teacher of literature
must ask is, what is the relative importance of all
these objects for which literature may be studied.
Which should be the main end of our teaching, and
which should be subordinate?  On the answer he
gives to that question will depend the method of his
teaching.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I have no doubt whatever as to which of
these things is the most important, although I may
have some doubts as to the relative importance of
the others.  To me a piece of literature is first and
foremost a work of art, a record of life in forms of
truth and beauty, a spiritual revelation; it speaks
to my intellect, but only that, through my intellect,
it may reach my heart.  If it reaches my intellect
only, if it penetrates no farther, if it does not become
part of my being, if the experience it records does
not become <i>my</i> experience, then it is of little value
to me, it is not <i>my</i> piece of literature, and I want no
literature that I cannot make my own.
</p>

<p>
I wish sincerely that we could root out for ever and
utterly abolish the false notion that most students
and many teachers have, that Literature is not an
important subject, that it is only a side-line, very
nice to know something about, but not in the same
class with "useful" and practical subjects like
history and science.  This is a tremendous and a
fatal misconception.  It is by Art and Art alone
that Humanity progresses; progress in Science or in
mere knowledge does not necessarily mean progress
in any of those things in which Man stands supreme
above the rest of creation, those spiritual qualities
which raise him to the level of the Divine.  We know
that a man may take a course in Science, or any purely
intellectual subject, and come out at the end of it
still uncultured and coarse-minded, with low ideals,
with the higher instincts undeveloped; he may go
through a course of Literature, too, it is true, and
emerge in a similar condition, but not if the Literature
has been properly presented to him, and if he has
really assimilated the best thoughts of the highest minds.
</p>

<p>
Art is the source of our highest pleasure, the
capacity for which raises us above the beast.  Without
that capacity, men are no better than sheep or goats
"who nourish a blind life within the brain."
</p>

<p class="poem">
A thing of beauty is a joy for ever,<br />
Its loveliness increases; it will never<br />
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep<br />
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep,<br />
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Not only is Literature the source of our highest
pleasure, but it is the source of our highest development.
It is the most potent factor in the slow process
of raising Humanity to a higher spiritual level; it is
the true motive power of the world.
</p>

<p>
Well might the poet say of himself and his fellow
poets:
</p>

<p class="poem">
We are the music-makers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are the dreamers of dreams,<br />
Wandering by lone sea-breakers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sitting by desolate streams;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
World-losers and world-forsakers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whom the pale moon gleams:<br />
We are the movers and the shakers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the world for ever it seems.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
One man with a dream, at pleasure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall go forth and conquer a crown:<br />
And three with a new song's measure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can trample a kingdom down.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Assuming, then, that the appreciation of literature
as art, as the record of spiritual experience, is the
principal thing to be gained from its study, the
question arises how is such an appreciation to be taught?
</p>

<p>
In what I am going to say on this subject, I will
speak of poetry, and you will understand my remarks
to apply in a lesser degree to prose.
</p>

<p>
Poetry is the finest flower of the human mind; and
therefore the most difficult of all things to appreciate.
In writing poetry the whole of a man's being is in
a state of intense activity.  His intellect, his emotion,
his imagination, are all roused to the highest pitch.
He is lifted for the time being to a plane of experience
much higher than the normal; he is giving out the
very best that is in him.
</p>

<p>
Wordsworth has described for us how the poetic
mood drove him distracted with intensity of thought
over hill and dale, and how when the mood had
passed he would return to his friends pale and utterly
exhausted both in mind and body.
</p>

<p class="poem">
His own mind did like a tempest strong<br />
Come to him thus and drove the weary wight along.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
All poetry worth reading is the result of some such
exalted mood as that, and poetry so written cannot
be read in cold blood.  Poetry which leaves you cold,
with your emotions untouched, which does not in
some measure lift you out of yourself, is either not
poetry at all, or else poetry which you have not the
capacity to appreciate.
</p>

<p>
One appreciates a poem only in so far as one
reproduces it sympathetically in oneself; that is,
only so far as one feels over again the emotions which
the writer who produced it felt as he gave them
expression.  In other words, by the appreciation of
literature one gains at second-hand the highest
spiritual experience.
</p>

<p>
It follows that one can appreciate poetry only to
the extent to which one is capable of such experience.
No one can appreciate fully all kinds of poetry; if
any one could do so, it would mean that he was a
universal genius, since the whole range of emotional
experience would have to be within his control.
The extent of the average man's powers of appreciation
is distinctly limited; some can sympathize only
with the more obvious and elemental emotions,
while some are capable of appreciating more subtle
and refined shades of feeling.  That is why nearly
every one can appreciate to some extent a poet like
Shakespeare, who always deals with big, elemental
emotions, although, since Shakespeare is at the same
time able to express the most subtle feelings, there
are few who can appreciate him in full.  This is why
it is more difficult to appreciate Wordsworth than
Shakespeare&mdash;Wordsworth's emotions are more out
of the range of ordinary experience&mdash;and still more
difficult to appreciate Shelley, whose range of emotion
is often entirely alien from experience.
</p>

<p>
The point I wish to make is that a teacher can
teach properly only poetry which he himself is capable
of appreciating, and therefore literature is the most
difficult of all subjects to teach, since it requires in
the individual certain qualifications beyond the
merely intellectual.  For the lack of these qualifications,
no brilliancy of intellect can compensate.
</p>

<p>
The teacher who knows a piece of poetry with
his head only can never teach it as it ought to be
taught.  He may be able to repeat it word for word,
he may know all about its history, its philology, its
structure, but if he has not felt it, if he has not
reproduced it sympathetically within himself, he cannot
teach it.  Similarly the student, unless he is capable
of sympathizing with such emotions as are recorded
in poetry, will be unable to get more than a head
knowledge of it.  If this power of sympathizing is
present in ever so small a degree, it can be indefinitely
developed under the inspiration of a good teacher.
</p>

<p>
What follows then?  First, that a teacher who
lacks the higher appreciation of literature can
certainly never teach it to others, although probably
thirty or forty per cent. of his pupils, more gifted
than himself by Nature in this respect, will get an
appreciation in spite of him.  Secondly, that even
supposing a teacher has this appreciation, it will be
of little use to him, unless he has the power of
communicating it to others, that is, of awakening in
them sympathy with what he himself feels.
</p>

<p>
Assuming, then, that the teacher has this appreciation,
what is the best way of communicating it?
There are, perhaps, only two possible ways.  One is
by talking about the poem, by trying to describe its
effect upon one; but the better and more effective
way is by reading, by vocal interpretation.  All
literature, but especially poetry, is written not for
the eye, but for the ear.  Its appeal, then, should
be made, not through the eye but through the ear.
The sound of the words, not singly, but in groups,
the rhythm, the intonation, all these give the
atmosphere of a poem.  Sound is to a poem what colour
is to a picture.  Get away from the printed word,
the mere symbol; it means something for the head,
it is true, but nothing for the heart until it is
translated into sound.
</p>

<p>
The first thing a teacher of literature must do, then,
is to learn to read.  He need not take a course in
elocution; stamping, gesticulating, waving his arms,
shouting, whispering, hissing, and other tricks of the
professional elocutionist will benefit him little; all
that is necessary is that he should be able, by the
intonation of his voice, to convey to his students the
effect which a poem has made upon himself.  Diligent
practice, the subjection of the voice to the
will&mdash;these are what he needs.  The average man cannot
hope to reach any very high degree of efficiency as a
reader, but all that the teacher needs is to be able
to read clearly, with a voice well controlled and
capable of expressing various shades of emotion,
with a good sense of rhythm and the grouping of
vowel sounds.
</p>

<p>
The first thing, then, for one who would teach
literature is to endeavour to reach at least that stage
of vocal culture which I have described.  Of course,
a good deal may be done in the way of conveying
appreciation of a poem by talking about it, but to
talk about a poem well is almost as difficult as to
read it well, and at the best is not nearly so effective.
</p>

<p>
Assuming that a man is equipped with these
essentials, a true appreciation of literature and the
power of communicating his appreciation to others,
how is he to approach the teaching of a piece of
literature?
</p>

<p>
The first thing he must do is to assimilate it
thoroughly himself, to go over it again and again,
to practise again and again the vocal interpretation
of it, to be sure that he has caught the spirit not
only of the whole, but of the smallest part, that no
shade of meaning, however subtle, has escaped him.
</p>

<p>
"We must long inhale," says Corson, "the choral
atmosphere of a work of genius before we attempt,
if we attempt at all, any intellectual formulation
of it; which formulation must necessarily be
comparatively limited, because genius, as genius, is
transcendental, and therefore outside the domain of
the intellect."
</p>

<p>
Then, having assimilated it, let him go further and
get a background for it.  Let him know, if possible,
its history, what suggested it, under what circumstances
it was composed, its relation to other writings
of the poet and of the age, what the best critics
have said about it, and so on.  Let him endeavour
to neglect no scrap of information which will increase
his own appreciation and understanding of the poem.
When he has done all this, then, and not till then,
is he ready to teach it.  If he has plenty of time and
a small class, he will probably begin by trying to find
out how far his pupils have assimilated the spirit
of the poem.  His task is then to interpret the piece
of literature, to try to give the student the impression
it has made on him, what it means to him, what
emotions it arouses in him.  This is to be done by
reading it, or, if the piece is long, by reading such
parts of it as will form a connected whole, filling in
with descriptive narrative.  In many cases it will be
necessary before attempting an interpretation to say
a few words which will enable the pupil to listen to
the reading in the proper frame of mind, and will
create the proper atmosphere for him.
</p>

<p>
When the first impression has been made, the work
has only just begun.  Suppose one has hit the right
keynote, that the class has caught the spirit of the
poem; there will still be much of it which is
unintelligible or misty to them.
</p>

<p>
Not realizing this, I used to make a mistake when
I first began to teach.  I thought it was necessary
that the pupils should understand the poem in detail
before they could get the general effect.  I used,
therefore, to begin by analysis, by pulling the poem
to pieces, showing its structure, the order of ideas,
the meaning of words, and when I thought everything
was perfectly clear I would give the general effect,
or very often would leave that to the students
themselves.  This was a fatal mistake.  By going through
the process of analysis first, I had rendered an
appreciation of the piece as a whole ever so much more
difficult; while if I had begun by trying to get the
general effect, and had succeeded, no amount of
analysis could have destroyed that first impression.
</p>

<p>
On this point Professor Corson says: "The spiritual
appeals which are made by every form of art, be it in
colour, in sound, in stone, in poetry, or whatever
may be the medium employed, must be responded
to directly, immediately (in the literal sense of the
word), or not at all.  Of course, the extent of the
response may be indefinitely increased.  But there
must be, to begin with, a direct, immediate response,
however limited it may be.  There is no roundabout
way to such appeals.  The inductive method is not
applicable to spiritual matters.  The very word
<i>induction</i>, is absurd, in connection with the spiritual.
It belongs exclusively to the intellectual domain."
</p>

<p>
When the first impression has been made, then
will come the analysis, and I am convinced that this
analysing process is one which the student, especially
the young student, cannot dispense with, and which
is an exceedingly valuable mental training.
</p>

<p>
The analysis will include a treatment not only of the
literary form of the poem, but a thorough study of its
language, of the historical and literary allusions
contained in it, of any images or metaphors which
may be obscure, and, in fact, anything which will
contribute to a better understanding of the poem
as a whole.  The teacher will now probably ask:
"How far is this process of analysis to go?  Must
one study the philology of every word, must one
analyse the metre of every poem?"  I have already
given the answer to these questions.  I said that the
analysis would include a study of anything which
<i>will contribute to the better understanding of the poem
as a whole</i>.  There is the secret.  The total effect must
never be lost sight of.  The metre is to be studied
only to an extent which will enable the student to
catch the rhythm and read the poem correctly for
himself.  Names and technicalities matter not a whit.
He may never have heard of an iambic pentameter,
or an anapaest, or a trochee, but as long as he grasps
the rhythm and sees the relations of the various
parts of the literary structure, he knows all that is
necessary for a thorough appreciation of the poem as
a whole.  Similarly, the derivation of a word should
never be given unless it helps to the better
understanding of the sense of the word <i>as that word is used
in the particular passage under discussion</i>; otherwise
the obtrusion of the etymology is simply an
impertinence.
</p>

<p>
Some teachers make interpretation by paraphrase
a prominent part of this analytical process; this
should be avoided.  It may be necessary sometimes
to paraphrase difficult passages, but not one-tenth
as often as most teachers and editors consider it
necessary.  A paraphrase is at best an inferior
rendering, a substitution of something similar, but
of a lower kind, often a substitution of the baldest
prose for the highest poetry.  "I pray thee avoid
it."  Some editors are over-fond of analysis;
probably because they wish to show they are earning
the money they get for editing.  Let the poem,
as far as possible, tell its own story in its own words.
</p>

<p>
When the analytic or discursive process has been
completed, what remains?  A return to the general.
Having considered the poem in its parts, one now
endeavours to reproduce the effect of the poem as a
whole, but this time, if the analysis has been well
done, the effect ought to be greatly heightened.
The student will now see, not through a glass darkly,
but will meet the poet face to face.
</p>

<p>
There are two things to be observed with regard
to this process from the general, through the
discursive, back to the general again.  One is that the
processes should, if possible, be kept separate; that
one should keep, if possible, at the same level
throughout any one lesson.  This cannot be done if one
changes from appreciation to analysis and back again
on the same day.  The second is that the analytic
process is best left as far as possible to the student
himself.  I myself used to make the mistake of doing
too much for the student; I used to try to analyse
the poem thoroughly for him in class.  I now think it
better simply to point out difficulties and leave them
to the student to solve, to suggest questions and leave
them to the student to answer.  The work may not
be so thoroughly done, but the student receives a
valuable stimulus which he would otherwise miss.
I always give an opportunity for any difficulties
which the student is unable to solve for himself to be
brought to me.
</p>

LECTURE II
</p>

<p>
In my last lecture I tried to emphasize what I
considered to be the most important objects of
literary study, <i>i.e.</i>, the appreciation of literature as
art.  I said that I thought it necessary that the
teacher of English should have both a true appreciation
of literature himself and the capacity for arousing
appreciation in others.  I pointed out that the
teacher's first duty was to awaken in his students a
response to the inner life or soul of the piece of
literature with which he was dealing, that the best way of
doing so was by a good vocal interpretation; and
that it was therefore the duty of every teacher of
English to learn to read well.  I suggested that after
the first response had been gained, there should come
a thorough analysis, a study of form, structure,
philology, and exact meaning, but that this process of
analysis should be carried only so far as was necessary
to a thorough appreciation of the work as a whole.
</p>

<p>
I now come to the question of how far a study
of the history of literature is desirable for the ordinary
student, I mean the student who does not desire
to specialize in the subject.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I am a firm believer in the historical
method of dealing with literature, not only because
I think that a knowledge of the history of literature
greatly heightens one's appreciation of literary
works, but because I believe that many students,
who would otherwise never do so, are by this method
led to take an interest in, and so gradually acquire
a taste for, literature.
</p>

<p>
Some books (using the word <i>book</i> in the sense of
any literary work) are for all time&mdash;Homer, Virgil,
Dante, Milton, Shakespeare; some books are for
their own time only; some books are for their own
time and a limited period afterwards.  But whatever
be the vitality of a book, no matter to which of these
classes it belongs, there is no doubt that it belongs
in the first instance to its own time, and cannot help
being to some degree a reflection of the spirit of the
age in which it was produced.  This means that not
only may the book be used as an historical document,
as a means of catching the spirit of its age, but that,
conversely, a study of the epoch at which it was
produced cannot fail to illuminate to a greater or less
degree the meaning of the book.
</p>

<p>
Critics like Taine and Sainte-Beuve looked on books
as primarily historical documents.  Behind the book
one looked for the man, behind the man one found
the innumerable circumstances which went to mould
his personality.  In this way of looking at things
the individual becomes of comparatively small
importance; he is interesting mainly because he is a
type of his age; his book is interesting because it
reveals the type.
</p>

<p>
Much can be said for this deterministic way of
looking at literature, and some excellent results
have been produced by Taine's style of criticism,
but few critics of to-day would look on it with favour.
To-day, the book is of primary importance; the man
and the age are studied that they may throw light
on the book.  However exaggerated the historical
method, as carried out by Taine, may appear, I think
we must admit that in a modified form it may be
of very great value.
</p>

<p>
We all know that a literary work is flavoured by the
personality of the writer.  From our experience as
teachers we learn that we can read a personal
document more sympathetically if we know who wrote it.
</p>

<p>
I have sometimes commenced to read an essay
under the impression that it was written by a student
A, and have been annoyed at certain ways of thinking
and methods of expression that seemed to me forced
and unnatural; I have turned to the back of the
essay, seen the name of the writer, discovered my
mistake, and re-read the essay with the personality
of B instead of A at the back of my mind, and then
the essay seemed to me to go smoothly, and to be
characteristic of the writer.
</p>

<p>
Undoubtedly, the book takes a distinct and peculiar
tinge from the personality of the author, and therefore
to get the proper atmosphere, to read a book with
thorough sympathy, we should find out all that we
possibly can about the man who wrote it.  Of course,
the thing works both ways.  We study the man that
we may better appreciate his book; we study the
book to find the man.  How little can be done in
some cases towards determining the personality
of the man from his book is shown by the outstanding
instance of Shakespeare.  More than three hundred
years' study of that marvellous book has entirely
failed to reveal the personality of the author; upon
that question critics are still in hopeless conflict.
</p>

<p>
Again, since the personality of a man is undoubtedly
moulded, to a large extent, by his age and environment,
we should go farther back still, and having
studied our man, we should relate him to his age.
</p>

<p>
No writer is so individualistic that he can wholly
escape the tinge of his epoch.  I will venture to say
that no one who has been accustomed to study
literature by the historical method, and to recognize
in books the contemporary flavour, would be likely
to take, say, a piece of prose written in the first half
of the seventeenth century for the product of the
eighteenth or nineteenth century, or could possibly
mistake a typical sixteenth-century lyric for a typical
nineteenth-century one.
</p>

<p>
If we study our literature, then, historically as well
as artistically, our books will be to us not only works
of art, but something more; they will become linked
to long trains of association, which will carry us out
into the life and happiness and suffering of our
fellow-men, and further still, out into the shock and sway
of great world-movements, into the sphere where the
Time-spirit weaves unceasingly the web of life.
</p>

<p>
Let me give you an example of how this way of
treating literature can be carried out with even a
junior class.
</p>

<p>
I have been studying with the Freshmen some of
Goldsmith's poetry, <i>The Traveller</i> and <i>The Deserted
Village</i>.  We first took the poems in themselves,
studied them as works of art, read them, tried to
get the spirit, then analysed and studied them in
detail.  We next went on to a study of the life of
Goldsmith.  We followed his strange and romantic
career, followed him in his sufferings and struggles
and triumphs, saw him in his weakness and in his
strength.  Further than that, we saw him in relation
to his contemporaries.  We became acquainted
through him with the famous circle of which he was
a member, the circle of wits and scholars that gathered
round Johnson&mdash;Burke, Reynolds, Garrick, and the
rest.  We then learned something of the literary
ideals of that school, and how they determined the
form of Goldsmith's work.  We saw, too, how Johnson
and Goldsmith helped to set literature free from the
bonds of patronage.  We saw something of the
politics and the social conditions of the age.
</p>

<p>
My claim is that, in consequence of that study, those
students, when they return to <i>The Traveller</i> and <i>The
Deserted Village</i> to read them again for their own
pleasure or to review them for their examination,
will find their pleasure in them greatly enhanced
by having at the back of their minds the personality
of the author and the spirit of his time.  Things that
seemed stiff and pedantic to them before will be
forgiven or passed over now, because they will know
that they do not belong to Goldsmith himself, but are
only a condition of his writing imposed on him by his
age; they will appreciate better all those passages in
which the kindliness and sympathy and generosity of
the author are strongly marked, and finally they will
feel hovering around these living documents not only
the spirit of the dead author, but the spirit of the
great old Doctor Johnson, with the spook of Boswell
probably still in attendance, and all that noble and
witty company who walked and talked on earth so
many years ago.
</p>

<p>
I have heard people object to the study of the
history of literature by young students on this
ground&mdash;that it must mean to a large extent a memorizing
of names and dates, a mere empty repetition of facts
about works that have never been read.
</p>

<p>
To that objection I do not now attach very much
weight, although at one time I did.  In the first
place, the study need not be a mere empty repetition.
A skilful description of the contents of a work will
give a student a very fair idea of its spirit and meaning,
and often arouse in him a desire to read it for himself.
In the second place, it is good for him that he should
have the benefit of the experience of the most
competent students and critics of English literature,
so that he may know what is best worth reading, and
so that when he comes to continue his studies for
himself, if he ever does, he may spend his time to the
best advantage.  One does not object to studying the
map of a country, even if there is no intention of
visiting all the places marked thereon.
</p>

<p>
I would say, then, that the best plan with the young
student who has had some elementary training in the
appreciation of literature is to take some representative
works of a particular period, and through a careful
study of them in the way I have described, reach
out and grasp the whole period in its essential features.
</p>

<p>
So much for the history of literature.  Now to
retrace our steps, and return to what I said in my first
lecture about the method of attacking a particular
literary work.  I daresay it sounded simple and easy
enough; first get your general effect, let the poem
make its own impression as a unit, as a work of art;
then will come your analysis, and then a return to the
general.
</p>

<p>
But it is in the application of this simple principle
to different kinds of literature that the teacher will
find his greatest problems.  Every new work will
provide a new puzzle.  How much need I say about
this by way of introduction?  What is the best way
to present this?  What illustrative extracts should
I make from this?  How much help should I give
the student with this?
</p>

<p>
A teacher has to teach the First Book of <i>Paradise
Lost</i>.  He has three quarters of an hour or an hour
to make his first impression; on that first impression
may depend the whole success of his teaching.  It is
obvious that with young students it will not do to
plunge straight into a reading of the poem; they must
be prepared for the reading; an atmosphere must be
created; they must come to the reading in a proper,
receptive attitude.  How much introduction is
necessary?
</p>

<p>
Personally, I spend one whole hour talking about
the poem.  I point out as well as I can the plan of
the whole poem, and how that plan is carried out,
so as to get the relation of the First Book to the whole;
I talk a little about epic poetry in general and what
one is to expect from an epic poem; I point out the
magnitude of Milton's task, the spirit in which he
approached his work, the purpose and meaning of
that work, and in every way I try to arouse an attitude
of interest and expectancy.
</p>

<p>
The next day, I do not begin to take up Book I in
fragments, but I give a reading designed to give the
story of the whole book in a series of the most striking
passages, strung together by connecting narrative.
</p>

<p>
We are now ready to study the poem analytically,
and as we take up each part and dissect it, the
students always have in view the relation of each part
to the whole book, and, from the first lecture, to the
whole poem.
</p>

<p>
How to teach a play of Shakespeare is a subject
that might well demand a whole lecture to itself.
Shakespeare is undoubtedly the best material for
teaching literature that we have, and is suitable for
all grades, from the lowest to the highest.  Of course,
I need scarcely say that the method of treatment
and presentation for honour students will naturally
differ entirely from that appropriate to beginners.
</p>

<p>
But there is one thing certain, that a play of
Shakespeare, whether one teaches it to beginners or to
advanced students, demands on the part of the
teacher a most intense study.  He must be soaked
in it; he must be thoroughly familiar with it down to
the smallest detail; he must have thought out the
setting of every scene; he must have formed a clear
conception of every character; he must have decided
definitely the exact tone and emphasis with which
every speech should be delivered; and lastly, he
must decide how he may most effectively present it
to his students.
</p>

<p>
But this, you will say, is putting too big a demand
upon the teacher.  It is a demand which few of us are
able to fulfil, but I am convinced myself that every
teacher should keep such an ideal in view, and work
toward it patiently.  I have been studying <i>Hamlet</i>
off and on myself for ten years, I have been teaching
it for four, and I am only just beginning to get some
confidence about it now.  I hope perhaps if I study
it for ten years more to be able to teach it with some
success.
</p>

<p>
The great actor Salvini studied the part of Lear
for eight years before he made any attempt to commit
it to memory.
</p>

<p>
Shakespeare is thus, in a sense, the most difficult of
all authors to teach, for one can never exhaust him;
in another sense he is the easiest, for even the poorest
teacher cannot help making some effect with him.
The latter fact, however, should not make us content
with slovenly work.
</p>

<p>
In this connection I may say that I am convinced
that the greatest aid to success on the part of the
teacher of English literature is painstaking and exact
study for himself&mdash;not to be content with something
that will do, but to absorb and reabsorb the spirit of
the best works, and never to be satisfied that he
knows them well enough.  The number of works that
he can know thus thoroughly will be limited at first,
but their range will be constantly increasing; and
therefore the work that he will be compelled to do in a
more or less imperfect fashion will be constantly
decreasing.
</p>

<p>
As an example of how a single poem can be made
sometimes to serve as an introduction to the whole
of an author's work or to a large portion of it, let us
take a very short and simple poem of Browning and
see what can be made of it.  Let me read to you
<i>A Woman's Last Word</i>.
</p>

<p>
Probably this poem, like many of Browning's,
produces at the first reading only a vague and indefinite
impression, a sort of groping sensation, in short, a
wonder as to what it is all about.
</p>

<p>
Let us analyse it.  Whence did the difficulty arise?
Evidently not from the language.  It was from the
fact that we did not know what went before; that
from what is given us here, a mere scrap of experience,
we had to construct the whole; and from the fact
that we had to follow a sequence of thoughts suggested
by circumstances unknown to us, instead of, as is
usual in poetry, a series of actions or events which
serve as a backbone or substructure for the thought.
</p>

<p>
Herein lie the two main difficulties of appreciating
that large class of Browning poetry known under
the heading, <i>dramatic monologues</i>.
</p>

<p>
They are <i>dramatic</i> because they are spoken not in
the person of the author, but in that of some
imaginary character, whose personality the author
assumes, but they differ from drama, as it is generally
understood, first, because they are monologues, not
dialogues; secondly, the circumstances, occasions,
and settings of the monologues, instead of being
suggested at the outset, are only indicated from time
to time, and have to be picked up as we go along;
thirdly, we have to follow a sequence of thoughts
without any help from accompanying events or
actions; and lastly, we are given no information,
except incidentally, as to what goes before and
comes after.
</p>

<p>
In other dramatic monologues of Browning the
problem becomes more complicated, first, from the
fact that in most of them he attempts to reveal a
character, not merely a psychological situation, as
in <i>A Woman's Last Word</i>; secondly, from the
extraordinary variety of the characters he attempts to
present.
</p>

<p>
The characters into whose mouths Browning puts
his poems are a very varied assortment.  In one
poem, perhaps, it is a Greek philosopher who speaks,
in the next a modern English divine; now it is an
Italian duke of the sixteenth century, and now an
Italian patriot of the nineteenth century.  Each of
these personages has a definite atmosphere and a
typical environment, and that atmosphere and
environment we must construct for ourselves before
we can appreciate the poem properly.
</p>

<p>
Take, for example, the two poems, <i>Fra Lippo Lippi</i>
and <i>Andrea del Sarto</i>.  Each of these deals not only
with the character and some of the history of an
individual Italian painter, but sets forth in addition
a particular phase in the development of Italian art,
and at the same time gives us an insight into Browning's
theory of art.  To appreciate these poems, then,
we must know something of the history of the
historic personages who are represented as speaking,
something of the Italy of their time; we must know
in outline at least something of the history of Italian
art, and have some knowledge of the technicalities of
painting.  Very many of Browning's poems are
concerned with periods and personages about whom
the ordinary reader knows nothing, hence the absolute
need of some sort of a commentary, or of constant
recourse to an encyclopaedia in reading him.
</p>

<p>
There is another difficulty connected with Browning's
favourite form, the dramatic monologue.  Most
of these poems are only scraps of experience; we get
no information, except by hints, of what has gone
before; we are equally left to guess what comes
after.  The problem before us is something like that
of reconstructing a whole conversation of which we
have overheard only a small part.
</p>

<p>
Again, many of the poems do not describe a series
of events, but only a series of thoughts or reflections.
Hence there is nothing or very little to guide us in
grasping the connection between the various parts
of the poem, and many of the poems have to be read
and re-read many times before the meaning begins
to dawn on us.
</p>

<p>
In <i>A Woman's Last Word</i> there is not a single
difficult phrase.  The whole difficulty arises from the
fact that it is a scrap, and from the fact that it is a
series of thoughts without any action to thread them
together and to make them definite.
</p>

<p>
Browning's poems are sometimes difficult to read
because the ideas which he is expressing are profound
and difficult to grasp; but far more often they are
difficult because of his extraordinary way of
expressing perfectly simple and easy ideas.
</p>

<p>
For example, here is a perfectly easy and obvious
thought&mdash;that every day we see men winning money
and reputation by mere imitation of some style that
has caught the public taste, while the original inventor
or discoverer of that style lives in obscurity and
neglect.  How does Browning express it?
</p>

<p class="poem">
Hobbs hints blue&mdash;straight he turtle eats,<br />
Nobbs prints blue&mdash;claret crowns his cup,<br />
Nokes outdares Stokes in azure feats&mdash;<br />
Both gorge.  Who finished the murex up?<br />
What porridge had John Keats?<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The point about the murex in this extract
illustrates another difficulty with Browning, his
assumption of knowledge on the part of his reader of all
sorts of curious and out-of-the-way information.  He
is full of allusions to technical points in such things
as painting, music, medicine, and classical scholarship
which are as a rule known to only specialists in these
particular subjects.
</p>

<p>
I might mention lastly in this connection a peculiarity
of Browning's thought, namely, its tremendous
rapidity.  Let me illustrate.  A beginner works out a
problem in mathematics; he feels his way step by
step; he puts down everything in order, and in
going over the question we can follow easily every
detail of the reasoning.  A master mathematician
confronted with the same problem would see his way
from the beginning right through to the end; he
would leave out half of the intermediate steps because
to him they were quite obvious and not worth putting
down, and when we came to look over his work we
might completely fail to see how he had reached his
conclusion.
</p>

<p>
So with Browning.  Browning skips from thought
to thought with great rapidity, leaving intermediate
steps to be filled in by the intelligence of the reader.
As Chesterton says, if Browning had to describe
a quarrel between two men which culminated in
one calling the other a liar and knocking him
downstairs, he would probably do it something like this:
</p>

<p class="poem">
What then?  You lie&mdash;and doormat below stairs<br />
Takes bump from back.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
That is to say, he would be in such a hurry to get
his man to the bottom of the stairs that he would
leave out half of the intermediate steps.
</p>

<p>
I have given you this fairly full discussion as an
example of how a rather difficult thing may be done,
namely, how a single poem may sometimes be used
to give an introduction to a poet and prepare a class
for reading the remainder of his work.
</p>

<p>
Before I close let me give you a couple of things
I have discovered about teaching which may be
useful to you.  First, it is more important to be
physically fit than to be well prepared.  If you feel well
and look it, your class will be in good humour even
if you are not well prepared.  Be worried and tired,
and your class will soon become worried and tired too.
Secondly, it is better to teach too little than too much.
Do not subject your class to mental indigestion.
Thirdly, one should always try to appear interested.
Lastly, one should never appear to be in a hurry.
Nothing annoys a class more than to be rushed madly
from point to point without a breathing space.

<h3>
MY LAST DUCHESS
</h3>

<p class="t3">
<i>A paper given in 1911 to a Church Society that wished<br />
guidance for literary study</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In this poem Browning takes his subject from the
midst of the Renaissance period in Italy, a period
when the revival of classical learning was accompanied
by a breakdown in the authority of the Church.  The
conventions of ages were swept away in a few years,
and side by side with the new culture, scepticism,
cynicism, robbery, lust, and murder prevailed in high
places, even in the palaces of the Popes themselves.
Under a thin veneer of culture, society became rotten
to the core.
</p>

<p>
The word <i>Ferrara</i> at the head of the poem gives
us the clue to the period.  Ferrara is an ancient
Italian town, and was at one time the seat of a
powerful duchy.  The ancient ducal palace still frowns
down from its eminence upon the country around.
The Duke of Ferrara at the period of our poem was
one of the most powerful noblemen of Italy.
</p>

<p>
The speaker in this monologue is the Duke of
Ferrara, a typical Renaissance product, cultured and
cold and cruel.  He is showing the picture of his
late wife to an envoy from some Count or other who
has sent to negotiate a marriage for his daughter
with the widowed Duke.
</p>

<p>
The first thing to do with a poem like this is to
make it live.  We will read it.
</p>

<p>
The character we have represented here is one
probably not uncommon at the period.  The Duke is a
man of intellect, imbued with the new culture, a
critic and collector of art treasures.  He combines
with this appreciation of art, an utter selfishness and
cynicism.  His heart is incapable of tenderness or
emotion.  He has an immense pride in his rank and
in his ancient name, and an impatience of anything
that would derogate from his dignity.
</p>

<p>
Can you picture him, the polished old villain, as
he stands before the picture of the girl he has cruelly
done to death and points out its beauties with delicate
jewelled finger?  On his cultured but sensual features
the critical appreciation of a connoisseur for the skill
of the artist mingles with some recollection of and
pride in the beauty of his former duchess; but of
affection there is not a sign, of remorse not a trace.
</p>

<p>
He married a young girl who probably was
contracted to him by her parents without having any
voice in the matter.  He bestows on her his name
and rank, and in return demands&mdash;<i>everything</i>, her
abject submission to his every whim, her complete
indifference to everything and everybody but himself.
It was too much.  The poor girl could not crush all
the humanity out of her heart, nor the vitality out
of her body.  The Duke saw, with cold disapproval,
her fresh interest and pleasure in all around her, her
delight in every attention that was offered her, her
ever-ready smile.  He wanted all these things for
himself, and for nobody else.  That smile must be
for him alone.  But unfortunately the Duchess liked
whatever "she looked on, and her looks went
everywhere," she had a kind word and glance for everybody.
</p>

<p class="poem">
This grew; I gave commands;<br />
Then all smiles stopped together.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
In other words, he did away with her, had her
murdered, an easy thing for a man of his power at this
epoch.  First, however, he had her portrait painted.
If he could not have the Duchess all to himself, he
could at least have her picture entirely his own,
</p>

<p class="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... since none puts by<br />
The curtain I have drawn for you, but I.<br />
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
He is thinking now of marrying again.  Some Count
snaps at the bait, the chance of this magnificent
alliance for his daughter.  Better to kill her with
his own hand than to let her pass into the clutches of
the Duke.  The Duke's object in showing the envoy
the picture is probably partly to get the opportunity
of letting him know in time what he expects from
his wife, so that when the messenger returns he may
warn his young lady to keep her smiles under strict
control.
</p>

<p>
Notice how Browning indicates the attitude of the
envoy.  First he is struck by the marvellous face of
the Duchess&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
The depth and passion of its earnest glance.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
At last he essays a word in her defence,
</p>

<p class="poem">
Who'd stoop to blame<br />
This sort of trifling?<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and when the Duke has finished, he sits a little
stupefied at the revelation that has been made, and
still gazing at the picture.  Even when the Duke rises
he does not stir, and the latter has to rouse him, a
little impatiently, "Will't please you rise?"
</p>

<p>
To me the most striking thing about this poem is
its suggestiveness.  It suggests infinitely more than it
expresses.  It expresses merely a fragment of a
conversation; it suggests a whole tragedy.
</p>

<p>
Browning has, in these few lines, with delicate and
curious skill, given us first the Renaissance
atmosphere, a mixture of culture and refinement, delight
in art and beauty, with immorality and crime; he has
suggested to us the characters of the two actors in the
drama from which this poem is but a fragment, the
polished and cynical Duke and the girl who is
sacrificed to his position and wealth; he has even
suggested the mixture of deference, loathing, and fear
with which the envoy listens to the Duke's description.
There are anatomists who from a single bone
of any animal will construct the whole skeleton; and
so from this scrap which Browning has here given us
we can construct the complete drama.
</p>

<p>
The poem is, as I have remarked, typical of a whole
class of Browning's poetry.  These poems are usually
called <i>dramatic monologues</i>, but perhaps the title
given to them by Stopford Brooke is on the whole
more suggestive.  He calls them <i>imaginative
representations</i>.
</p>

<p>
These poems are, in the first place, the utterance
of one person, at a single time, and in one place.
Some individual is influenced or induced by some
unusual opportunity or circumstance to reveal
himself.  The veil which conceals his inmost heart is
lifted for a moment and we get a glimpse into its
depths.
</p>

<p>
They have a certain dramatic element.  Browning
himself styled this poem a <i>dramatic romance</i>.  They
are dramatic in that they are objective as regards
the author; the poet is not uttering his own thoughts.
The circumstances under which the monologue is
spoken are usually dramatic (<i>i.e.</i>, such as a playwright
might choose to bring out some trait of character),
the background, scenery, and even the action is
vividly suggested, and there are usually subsidiary
figures whose attitude towards the central actor is
carefully indicated.
</p>

<p>
The chief point to notice about these poems is
that the poet studies not merely an individual as
such, the working out of passion in a single soul, but
he takes that individual as a type of some special
period, some phase of historical development, some
special era of thought.  It was Browning's way of
using history for poetical purposes, and it was
completely his own.  This poem is not a very good
example, because the personages and events
described are not peculiar to any one epoch, but may
occur wherever there are two people unhappily
married.  But even here we have in the Duke not
only an intensely interesting, even if objectionable,
type of human being, but the concentrated essence
of a certain side of the Italian Renaissance.
</p>

<p>
Browning, in his series of <i>imaginative representations</i>
has covered a big field.  <i>Artemis Prologuizer,
Caliban on Setebos, The Bishop Orders his Tomb, Fra
Lippo Lippi, A Death in the Desert, Cleon</i>, and many
others cover an immense range, from Greek mythology
through early and late Renaissance down to the
modern life of Europe.  "The poet can place us with
ease and truth at Corinth, Athens or Rome, in Paris,
Vienna or London, and wherever we go with him
we are at home."  Scenery, character, time, place,
and action are all suitably and harmoniously blended,
the characters are vividly alive.  The qualifications
which Browning brought to these poems were, first,
a wide historical knowledge, not so much of separate
events as of the main trend of thought in a given
period; an intense imaginative power; a wide
knowledge of human nature; and last, but not least,
in his Italian poems, a familiar acquaintance with
"a multitude of small intimate details of the customs,
clothing, architecture, popular dress, talk and scenery
of the towns and country of Italy from the thirteenth
century to modern times."  The poem under
consideration gives us only a glimpse of the skill with
which Browning handles this particular type; but
I hope it will be sufficient to induce those who are
not acquainted with Browning's other work to study
it further.

<h3>
REALISM IN WORDSWORTH AND BROWNING
</h3>

<p class="t3">
<i>A paper read to the Faculty Club during the<br />
session</i> 1911-12<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
What is Realism?  Realism means what it
says&mdash;truth to reality and fact.  The realist
expresses imaginative conceptions in terms of the
actual world around him, in terms of the objects
which he can see and describe accurately; the idealist
gets away from fact, and creates an imaginative
world which differs from the real.
</p>

<p>
The idealist who writes of love, talks about raptures
and bliss and gates of heaven; the realist describes
the wave of the girl's hair, the colour of her dress, the
way in which the man stands and looks, and leaves
the reader to supply the emotional background.
The idealist who writes of death talks about ashes
to ashes, dust to dust, the common goal of mortality,
the gate of everlasting life; the realist describes the
sick man's ghastly pallor, his wavering pulse, his
gasping breath, the clock ticking out the minutes in
the silence of the chamber of death.
</p>

<p>
A realist in fiction like Balzac or Flaubert or their
imitator, Arnold Bennett, seems almost photographic
in the accuracy of his descriptions; and yet so artistic
is the selection of the details described that though
we get the impression of absolute reality, the
emotional atmosphere is often intense.  Realism,
when well done, is an admirable literary method,
but it may and often does degenerate into a vice.
In the hands of Zola it becomes a medium for the
conveyance of sickening, sordid, or disgusting detail.
</p>

<p>
The kind of realism with which I wish to deal
is <i>realism in poetry</i>&mdash;the phrase seems almost a
contradiction in terms&mdash;and I am taking for my
purpose certain phases of the work of Wordsworth and
Browning.
</p>

<p>
Wordsworth and Browning, two poets in many
respects direct antitheses of one another, are not
usually classed together in any way.  There is,
however, one class of poetry which Browning was the
first to develop to a large extent, in which
Wordsworth may be said to have been a pioneer; in fact,
Browning actually succeeded in a kind of poetry of
which Wordsworth barely saw the possibility.  I
do not mean to suggest that Browning was in any
way a disciple or conscious imitator of Wordsworth;
but that we see in full flower in Browning's poetry a
certain artistic method of which in Wordsworth's
poetry we can just perceive the germ.
</p>

<p>
The kind of poetry to which I refer is one which is
frequent in Browning, and which, in fact, has often
been regarded as not poetry at all&mdash;I mean such
utterly unpretentious, prosaic, uncouth, rough, or at
times even grotesque verse as we find in poems like
<i>Bishop Blougram's Apology, Mr. Sludge the Medium,
Old Pictures in Florence, Master Hugues of Saxe-Gotha</i>,
much of <i>The Ring and the Book</i>, and Browning's
later work generally.  Such verse produces the effect
of an exact reproduction of the actual.  It is so
realistic that it seems at times lacking in art.
</p>

<p>
No work which is an exact, or nearly exact,
reproduction of the actual can be a work of art.  A work
of art is based on man's experience of what is, but
is always modified and altered by his conception of
what ought to be.
</p>

<p>
It was here that Wordsworth failed.  His realistic
poetry is too close to the actual.  The intensely
realistic effect of Browning's poems is an illusion;
otherwise his claim to be a poetic artist disappears
in so far as these poems are concerned.
</p>

<p>
I wish to indicate the nature of these effects,
and to inquire how far Browning was anticipated by
Wordsworth.
</p>

<p>
Wordsworth was perhaps the chief representative
of the Romantic School&mdash;the title given to the group
of poets who dominated English Literature at the
commencement of the nineteenth century.  The
spirit of the age to which their work gave expression
was one of question and revolt, the spirit which
found its most remarkable political expression in the
French Revolution.  Question of established beliefs,
revolt against established rules and conventions, was the
keynote of literary as well as of social and political life.
</p>

<p>
The attitude of the Romantic School is indicated by
its name.  Romance is that element in literature which
appeals to the sense of the marvellous in man, which
awakens his capacity for wonder.  In the eighteenth
century, under the régime of Pope and the Classical
School, wonder had been dead.  It was an age of
acceptance and submission; acceptance of certain
definite conventions, submission to certain fixed
rules.  Correctness was more desired than imagination,
and polish than originality.
</p>

<p>
It was against the barren conventions and narrow
outlook of the Classical School that Wordsworth and
his fellows revolted.  The spirit of wonder toward
Nature and toward Man sprang into new life.
</p>

<p>
My meaning will be illustrated by the following
lines:
</p>

<p class="poem">
A primrose by a river's brim<br />
A yellow primrose was to him,<br />
And it was nothing more.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
They might have been written of Pope.  What was
the primrose to Wordsworth?
</p>

<p class="poem">
To me the meanest flower that blows can give<br />
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I do not wish, however, to talk to-night of Wordsworth's
attitude towards Nature.  It is with just two
aspects of the Romantic Revolt that I have to deal,
one relating to subject matter, the other to form.
</p>

<p>
The poet's eye in Shakespeare's time
</p>

<p class="poem">
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;<br />
And as imagination bodies forth<br />
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen<br />
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing<br />
A local habitation and a name.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
With Pope, poetry was confined mainly to man as he
exists in society, and was largely concerned with
satirizing social defects; Wordsworth dealt with
men as human beings, as mysterious manifestations
of the infinite, creatures trailing clouds of glory,
coming we know not whence, going we know not
whither.  To him, as to Burns, rank and station were
nothing.  Any human being, however humble, was
worthy to be the poet's theme.  He claimed for the
misfortunes of Lucy Gray or the miserable mother,
the Idiot Boy or Peter Bell, the same consideration
as Sophocles for the sorrows of OEdipus and the lofty
line of Thebes.
</p>

<p>
Gray, an eighteenth century poet in whom romantic
tendencies are found, shows the same spirit in the
<i>Elegy</i> when he writes of the humble dead who lie
beneath the soil:
</p>

<p class="poem">
Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,<br />
Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;<br />
Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile<br />
The short and simple annals of the poor.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Wordsworth, then, enlarged the scope of poetry to
include any human experience, however humble.
</p>

<p>
There was another side to Wordsworth's revolt.
He revolted not only against the limitations of
subject imposed on the poets by eighteenth-century
ideals, but also against the limitations of form.  Pope
and his followers had been poets of practically a
single metre, the heroic couplet.  Their tricks,
mannerisms, and phraseology had been exalted into a
<i>poetic diction</i>, or, rather, jargon, by countless
imitators, and poems written in any other style were
not allowed admission to the best company.  A field,
for example, had to be either a <i>verdant mead</i> or a
<i>grassy sward</i>, or it could not decently make its
appearance in poetry.  As late as the beginning of
the nineteenth century a rainbow is to Campbell
<i>Heaven's ethereal bow</i>, and a musket becomes, in
poetical dress, <i>a glittering tube</i>.  Wordsworth claimed
for the poet the right of using the language of
everyday life, plain, simple, and unadorned.
</p>

<p>
Such is a very brief and insufficient outline of the
two main points in Wordsworth's <i>poetic theory</i>, which
were developed at great length by Wordsworth himself
in his prefaces and by Coleridge in the <i>Biographia
Literaria</i>.
</p>

<p>
It is to just one small part of Wordsworth's <i>poetic
practice</i> that I wish to draw your attention.  I
mean certain studiously simple and realistic poems
written in deliberate illustration of his theories.  The
first of them were published in the famous <i>Lyrical
Ballads</i> of 1798, a work which burst like a bombshell
upon an astonished literary world, and aroused more
scorn, indignation, and controversy than perhaps
any other volume of poetry ever published.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> was in the nature of a challenge.
It contained an announcement of Wordsworth's new
theories, together with illustrations of them by himself
and Coleridge.  Many of the poems were admirable,
but in many others Wordsworth is at his worst.
</p>

<p>
A generation brought up in the principles of Pope
and nourished on such verse as <i>The Pleasures of Hope</i>
could not away with poems like <i>The Idiot Boy</i>, or
<i>Alice Fell</i>, or even <i>We Are Seven</i>.
</p>

<p>
There is no doubt that Wordsworth went much
too far in his zeal for the new theories, and was
unfortunately without a sense of humour which
might have saved him from absurdities.  As an
illustration of Wordsworth at his worst, let us take
<i>The Idiot Boy</i>, one of the poems in the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>.
The very outline of the plot would make the ghost
of Pope rise in indignation from the grave.  Old
Susan Gale, a peasant woman, is very ill.  Her
neighbour, Betty Foy, comes to attend on her,
accompanied by her only son, Johnny, an idiot.  Susan
gets worse, and the doctor must be sent for.  Betty
dare not leave her, and so the only alternative is to
send the idiot boy to fetch him.  I need not complete
the story, but will quote a few stanzas from the poem:
</p>

<p class="poem">
But when the pony moved his legs,<br />
Oh! then for the poor idiot boy!<br />
For joy he cannot hold the bridle,<br />
For joy his head and heels are idle,<br />
He's idle all for very joy.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
And Susan's growing worse and worse,<br />
And Betty's in a sad quandary;<br />
And then there's nobody to say<br />
If she must go, or she must stay!<br />
She's in a sad quandary.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"Oh Doctor!  Doctor! where's my Johnny?"<br />
"I'm here, what is't you want with me?"<br />
"Oh sir! you know I'm Betty Foy<br />
And I have lost my poor dear boy<br />
You know him&mdash;him you often see;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"He's not so wise as some folks be."<br />
"The Devil take his wisdom!" said<br />
The Doctor looking somewhat grim,<br />
"What, woman, should I know of him?"<br />
And grumbling, he went back to bed.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
This from a poet who could write <i>The Solitary Reaper</i>
or <i>Milton, thou should'st be living at this hour</i>, or such
magnificent philosophical poetry as we find in <i>The
Prelude, Tintern Abbey</i>, and <i>The Excursion</i>, where
Wordsworth treats of
</p>

<p class="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mind of man,<br />
The haunt and the main region of my song;<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
or such splendid descriptive passages as are scattered
everywhere through his works, visions worthy to
rank with Shakespeare's
</p>

<p class="poem">
Cloud-capped towers and gorgeous palaces.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Other examples of Wordsworth's simple style are
all too numerous, and may be found in such poems
as <i>Peter Bell</i>, which relates the story of a tinker and a
donkey (in parts an admirable poem), <i>Alice Fell</i>,
which tells the sorrow of a little girl for her tattered
cloak, <i>The Brothers</i>, and <i>Michael</i>.  These are not, by any
means, all bad; in fact, when Wordsworth can forget
for a while that he is writing to illustrate a theory,
flashes of his natural style break out, producing odd
effects of incongruity.  Some of the poems which
appeared in the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> are admirable, such
as <i>Her Eyes are Wild</i> and <i>The Affliction of Margaret</i>.
</p>

<p>
To us who have, since Wordsworth's time, been
trained to a wider scope of appreciation in poetry,
it will seem strange that even the worst of them should
have aroused such adverse criticism, but even to us
it is evident that Wordsworth in them is not at his
best, that he is writing a style which is not natural
to him.  And yet it was these poems which, for a
time, attracted most attention from Wordsworth's
contemporaries, and prejudiced Byron, Horace Smith,
Peacock, and many others against his greater poetry.
</p>

<p>
Wordsworth, though he failed in his attempt, had
got hold of a true idea&mdash;that the most common things
in life are pregnant with poetry, and that there are
many subjects, not susceptible of ordinary poetical
treatment, which may yet be handled in such a
simple, unpretentious way as to retain their essential
outlines, while the emotional element is subtly
indicated rather than actually expressed.  As a very
ordinary landscape will be transformed into a thing
of beauty under the rays of the setting sun, so
commonplace subjects may take on a new appearance
under the influence of the poet's imagination.  Care
must be taken, however, not to idealize too much.
It would be impossible, for example, to lift such a
subject as <i>The Idiot Boy</i> into the realm of the ideal.
</p>

<p>
Now if we turn to Browning, we find that he also
deals with subjects of this kind.  Let us consider his
treatment of one or two of them.  In <i>The Spanish
Cloister</i> he takes as his subject the mean and petty
jealousy of one commonplace monk for another.
Or, again, he takes a sick man, stretched on his
death-bed, putting aside impatiently the ministrations of
the parson, as his half-dazed thoughts go back to a
rather sordid love affair which was yet the brightest
spot in his past.  Other examples are <i>Sludge the
Medium</i>, and the cynical and worldly Bishop
Blougram endeavouring after dinner over the nuts
and wine to justify his appearance of orthodoxy to
Gigadibs, the scribbler and shallow rationalist:
</p>

<p class="poem">
So, you despise me, Mr. Gigadibs.<br />
No deprecation&mdash;nay, I beg you, sir!<br />
Beside 'tis our engagement: don't you know,<br />
I promised, if you'd watch a dinner out,<br />
We'd see truth dawn together?&mdash;truth that peeps<br />
Over the glass's edge when dinner's done,<br />
And body gets its sop and holds its noise<br />
And leaves soul free a little.  Now's the time&mdash;<br />
'Tis break of day!  You do despise me then.<br />
And if I say, "despise me,"&mdash;never fear&mdash;<br />
I know you do not in a certain sense&mdash;<br />
Not in my arm-chair for example: here,<br />
I well imagine you respect my place<br />
(Status, <i>entourage</i>, worldly circumstance)<br />
Quite to its value&mdash;-very much indeed<br />
&mdash;Are up to the protesting eyes of you<br />
In pride at being seated here for once&mdash;<br />
You'll turn it to such capital account!<br />
When somebody, through years and years to come,<br />
Hints of the bishop&mdash;names me&mdash;that's enough&mdash;<br />
"Blougram?  I knew him"&mdash;(into it you slide)<br />
"Dined with him once, a Corpus Christi Day,<br />
All alone, we two&mdash;he's a clever man&mdash;<br />
And after dinner&mdash;why, the wine you know&mdash;<br />
Oh, there was wine, and good!&mdash;what with the wine...<br />
'Faith, we began upon all sorts of talk!<br />
He's no bad fellow, Blougram&mdash;he had seen<br />
Something of mine he relished&mdash;some review&mdash;<br />
He's quite above their humbug in his heart,<br />
Half-said as much, indeed&mdash;the thing's his trade&mdash;<br />
I warrant, Blougram 's sceptical at times&mdash;<br />
How otherwise?  I liked him, I confess!"<br />
<i>Che ch'è</i>, my dear sir, as we say at Rome,<br />
Don't you protest now!  It's fair give and take;<br />
You have had your turn and spoken your home truths&mdash;<br />
The hand's mine now, and here you follow suit.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Could anything be more easy, conversational,
realistic?  And yet every now and then we find
throughout the poem touches of the noblest poetry
introduced so skilfully that there is no sense of
incongruity.  For example, the Bishop in the course
of his argument says that absolute unbelief is just as
impossible as absolute faith.
</p>

<p class="poem">
And now what are we? unbelievers both,<br />
Calm and complete, determinately fixed<br />
To-day, to-morrow, and for ever, pray?<br />
You'll guarantee me that?  Not so, I think.<br />
In no-wise! all we've gained is, that belief,<br />
As unbelief before, shakes us by fits,<br />
Confounds us like its predecessor.  Where's<br />
The gain? how can we guard our unbelief?<br />
Make it bear fruit to us?&mdash;the problem here.<br />
Just when we are safest, there's a sunset-touch,<br />
A fancy from a flower-bell, some one's death,<br />
A chorus-ending from Euripides&mdash;<br />
And that's enough for fifty hopes and fears<br />
As old and new at once as Nature's self,<br />
To rap and knock and enter in our soul,<br />
Take hands and dance there, a fantastic ring,<br />
Round the ancient idol, on his base again&mdash;<br />
The grand Perhaps! we look on helplessly&mdash;<br />
There the old misgivings, crooked questions are&mdash;<br />
This good God&mdash;what he could do, if he would,<br />
Would, if he could&mdash;then must have done long since:<br />
If so, when, where, and how? some way must be&mdash;<br />
Once feel about, and soon or late you hit<br />
Some sense, in which it might be, after all.<br />
Why not, "The Way, the Truth, the Life?"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Browning's love poetry does not properly enter
into this discussion, since love is a common theme of
poets, and this discussion deals with Browning's
treatment of apparently unpoetical themes; but
Browning's choice and treatment of situation in his
love poems are so unusual as to bring them into the
same class as his other realistic poems.  Take as an
example:
</p>

<p class="poem">
See, how she looks now, drest<br />
In a sledging-cap and vest.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis a huge fur cloak&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a reindeer's yoke<br />
Falls the lappet along the breast:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleeves for her arms to rest,<br />
Or to hang, as my love likes best.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
These few examples will serve to show that the
essential principles of Browning's realism and
Wordsworth's are the same.  Browning, like Wordsworth,
claimed for poetry a greater licence both in subject
matter and in form, but he went farther than
Wordsworth in both.  Wordsworth took for his new subjects
the humble joys and sorrows of the poor&mdash;but all
was fish that came to Browning's net.  Any psychological
situation, any out-of-the-way corner of human
experience, became in his hands matter for poetry.
Then as to form, Wordsworth merely refrained from
the conventional language of poetry, but Browning
boldly used language that was frankly unpoetical&mdash;uncouth,
unmusical, rough, rhyming grotesquely,
accented outrageously.  Perhaps his most important
advance on Wordsworth was in the use of the dramatic
form&mdash;nearly all Browning's poems of the sort
described are dramatic monologues&mdash;for when the
speaker is professedly not the poet, we are less inclined
to find an incongruity in unpoetical language.
Browning, by adopting the dramatic form, gets at things
from the subjective point of view, from the inside.
Wordsworth tried to describe them objectively from
the point of view of a spectator.
</p>

<p>
Browning, then, practically discovered a new
poetical form which enabled him to bring within the
scope of poetical treatment subjects never so treated
before.  He found a new field for poetry and found
new forms to suit it.  He entered land which
Wordsworth had only beheld from afar, and which, indeed,
Wordsworth never could have entered.
</p>

<p>
Browning saw that familiar objects, everyday
doings and sayings, commonplace happenings which
seem to the ordinary observer prosaic and barren,
are, to the poet, pregnant with underlying emotion.
</p>

<p>
Ordinary poetry deals with the obviously poetical
things, or converts the everyday things of life into
poetry by depriving them of some of their actuality.
Browning contrives to give us things as they are,
with all the harshness and crudeness of real life,
and yet to make us feel the underlying element of
poetry.  About his most brutally realistic poem, there
is a subtle atmosphere of emotion.
</p>

<p>
Browning, like Shakespeare, dares to place side
by side the grotesque, the beautiful, the tragic, the
ludicrous.  He can do it by virtue of his unassuming
form.  Take, for example, <i>Old Pictures in Florence</i>.
There we get the dirt of the old streets, the very
must and smell of the second-hand dealer's stores,
the filthy canvas and peeling fresco, but we get also
the tragedy of the wronged Old Masters, and a noble
conception of the development of art.
</p>

<p>
In <i>Bishop Blougram</i> we get the wine, the nuts,
the plausible conversation, but we get also the
spectacle, pregnant with emotional possibilities, of
two human midgets in the presence of the Almighty,
the one daring lightly to compound with his Maker,
the other lightly to deny Him.
</p>

<p>
The value of this inquiry, if it have any value,
is to show that those poetical forms which are
often assumed to be due to a radical defect in
Browning's work as poetry, were really a deliberate
artistic method, deliberate in the sense that Carlyle's
style is deliberate.  The style, with both Carlyle and
Browning, is indeed the man, but each had to find
the style which would express him best.  Carlyle,
in his early work, wrote like Macaulay; Browning,
in his early work, wrote like Shelley.  And whenever
Browning, in his later poems, met with a subject
capable of conventional poetical treatment, he did
not hesitate so to treat it.
</p>

<p>
I need only instance such poems as <i>Saul, Abt
Vogler, The Guardian Angel</i>, and <i>Prospice</i>.  I shall
quote the last of these poems:
</p>

<p class="poem">
Fear death?&mdash;to feel the fog in my throat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mist in my face,<br />
When the snows begin, and the blasts denote<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am nearing the place,<br />
The power of the night, the press of the storm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post of the foe;<br />
Where he stands, the Arch Fear in a visible form,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the strong man must go;<br />
For the journey is done and the summit attained,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the barriers fall,<br />
Though a battle's to fight ere the guerdon be gained,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reward of it all.<br />
I was ever a fighter, so&mdash;one fight more,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best and the last!<br />
I would hate that death bandaged my eyes, and forbore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bade me creep past.<br />
No! let me taste the whole of it, fare like my peers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heroes of old,<br />
Bear the brunt, in a minute pay glad life's arrears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of pain, darkness, and cold.<br />
For sudden the worst turns the best to the brave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black minute's at end,<br />
And the elements' rage, the fiend-voices that rave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall dwindle, shall blend,<br />
Shall change, shall become a peace out of pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a light, then thy breast,<br />
O thou soul of my soul!  I shall clasp thee again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with God be at rest!<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Can anyone after hearing that poem maintain that
Browning was incapable, when he wished, of
dispensing with eccentricities?
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, I should like to say that the subject
I have been treating has nothing to do with the
obscurity of Browning's poetry.  His obscurity has
nothing to do with his realism.

<h3>
SYNGE
</h3>

<p class="t3">
<i>Incomplete notes of an Address to a Study Club</i>
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Three years ago, in July 1910, died John
Millington Synge, Irish dramatist, whose name
will probably be better known twenty years hence,
perhaps one hundred and twenty years hence, than
it is to-day.
</p>

<p>
Those who know Ireland only by hearsay, or from
books, or even from the stage, will be slow at first to
appreciate his work; but we who know and love the
real Ireland, we, who have wandered through her
glens and by her streams, and looked upon her
wonderful skies, who have felt within ourselves her
sadness, her mirth, and her poetry, must at once
acknowledge that in the work of Synge the soul of
Ireland has, for the first time, received adequate
expression.  In that small island, a green speck in
the tumbling billows of the Atlantic, right in the
heart of the barren conventionalism of modern
civilization, there still remains, if one knows where to
look for it, the Celtic spirit in all its original purity;
there is still to be found a glamour and a mystery
as fine as any that lingers on the shores of old
Romance.
</p>

<p>
Many have found and felt these things, but they
have been silent, for they have been restrained from
speech by a sense that such things could not be
interpreted in words.  Synge was the first to find
the medium by which they might be expressed.
"He was a solitary, undemonstrative man," says his
friend Yeats, "never asking pity, nor complaining,
nor seeking sympathy; all folded up in brooding
intellect, knowing nothing of new books and
newspapers, reading the great masters alone; and he
was but the more hated because he gave his country
what it needed, an unmoved mind, where there is
a perpetual last day, a trumpeting and coming up to
judgment."
</p>

<p>
Thus, it seems to me, Synge will be slow in winning
recognition from the masses of his countrymen.  He
saw them too clearly, and painted too accurate a
portrait of them to be flattering; they recognize
their weaknesses and are indignant, while they fail
to see that he has painted also their fine poetical
qualities, their romance, and their tenderness.
</p>

<p>
Again the same writer: "In Ireland, he loved only
what was wild in its people and in the grey wintry
sides of many glens."  All the rest, all that one
reasoned over, fought for, read of in leading articles,
all that came from Education, all that came down
from young Ireland&mdash;aroused in him little interest.
Perhaps its only effect on him was to awaken in him
first that irony which, once awakened, he turned upon
the whole of life.
</p>

<p>
The scene of Synge's later literary work&mdash;the
work which counts&mdash;was the Abbey Theatre, a small
and unpretentious building, hidden away in a side
street near the Dublin quays.  Here is a central
point for the Irish Dramatic Movement, a movement
recognized by all competent critics as being one of
the most significant things in modern literature.
Lovers of literature of the present generation who
have been walking in a vain shadow, groping their
way uneasily amid realistic novels, paradoxical
problem plays, pale poems, and epigrammatic essays,
turn with relief to a literature which is realistic,
and at the same time rich and poetical, and which
shows unmistakable signs of real vitality.
</p>

<p>
At the Abbey Theatre one may see the peasant
life of modern Ireland and hear the beautiful legends
of her past portrayed by native actors, with a fidelity
and a force which have never been surpassed on any
stage.  Their acting is a true "holding of the mirror
up to Nature"&mdash;there are no stage tricks, no
declamations, no poses, no sound and fury&mdash;the scene is
perhaps the rude interior of a peasant cottage in some
Irish village, or of a hut in some lonely glen, or the
side of a windy hill or open field, where the sun shines
and the air is mild and the breeze fresh and kindly.
The figures that fill the scene bear no resemblance to
the traditional buffoon, who, on most stages, is made
to do duty for an Irishman; their speech is quite
unlike the traditional brogue which is commonly
supposed to be the medium of communication between
Irish peasants; the characters represented are
primitive but poetical, wild but noble; their dialogue is
rich with humour and imagination, and is spoken
with a charming and musical intonation.  In the
movements and words of the people we see on the
stage, there is no appearance of acting; they talk
easily and naturally, their gestures are few and
altogether free from exaggeration or striving after
effect.  Their whole performance is simple and
apparently without effort; and yet I have again and
again been far more profoundly stirred by this
unpretentious acting, I have had a far deeper sense of
the tragedy and comedy and mystery of life in this
little Abbey Theatre than I have ever received from
the elaborate productions of the London stage.
</p>

<p>
The Irish National Theatre was founded in 1899
by W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory, who, ever since
its inception, have devoted their time and thought
and work almost exclusively to perfecting this new
drama.  The result has amply justified their faithful
labour.  The Irish National Theatre has already
given to the world an entirely original style of acting,
a company of actors "unrivalled in the quality
which they profess," and now known not only in
Ireland, but all over Britain and America, and also
several dramatists of extraordinary merit.
</p>

<p>
Of these dramatists Synge is undoubtedly the most
remarkable.  His production is small and extends
over only a few years, but it is of a quality unknown
in English literature since Elizabethan times.  "It
has been claimed for him," says Mr. Bickley, "that
he is the greatest imaginative dramatist who has
written English since Shakespeare, or at least since
the Puritans closed the theatres in 1642."  This
claim may at first sight seem extravagant, especially
to those who know the very limited range and
quantity of Synge's work, but on reflection it is
clear that if one admits that Synge is a great
dramatist, one is forced also to admit that he is the first
since Shakespeare.  What have we had in drama
since Shakespeare?  A number of classical or
pseudo-Shakespearean verse plays, most of them extremely
dreary, from Addison to Swinburne, the brilliant
but tawdry comedy of intrigue of the Restoration,
the later eighteenth-century society comedy of
Goldsmith and Sheridan, and the modern drawing-room
dramas of Shaw and Wilde&mdash;to none of which
the term great can properly be applied.
</p>

<p>
A study of the causes of the decay of the drama
would be a most interesting one, but the topic is too
large and too difficult to be attempted in a short
paper.  Suffice it to say, that Synge appeared to
believe that the modern drama suffered from two
main defects.  Either it lacked reality, or it lacked
poetry.  The drama which was imaginative and
poetical was alien from real life, the drama which
attempted a realistic picture of life was flat and
joyless and anaemic.
</p>

<p>
According to this idea two main things were
necessary to a re-creation of the drama.  First, the
type of life in which there still remained some vigour,
colour, and poetry; where convention had not crushed
out all elemental emotions and produced a barren
artificial uniformity; secondly, an artistic language
by which that life might be expressed.  Synge found
both these requisites among the Irish peasantry of
Connemara and the Aran Islands.  In Mr. Bickley's
books we learn how W. B. Yeats found Synge.
Synge was then twenty-six.  "He had wandered
among people whose life is as picturesque as that of
the Middle Ages, playing his fiddle to Italian sailors
and listening to stories in Bavarian woods, but life
had cast no light into his writings."
</p>

<p>
Following Yeats' advice, Synge left France and
went to live at Aran, a group of stony islands at the
entrance of Galway Bay.  "There he lived the
peasants' life, learned their language and discovered
his own possibilities."  In the Aran peasants he
found a people with "an imagination, fiery and
magnificent and tender," and at the same time
with the elemental emotions strongly in evidence,
a just mixture of God and brute.  Synge found
splendid material for a drama at once human and
beautiful; in their language, English spoken by men
who thought in Gaelic, that is, English coloured by
Celtic imagination, he found his medium of expression.
The result was the half-dozen plays which will
probably survive most of the other writing of this
generation.
</p>

<p>
To find the Ireland of romance, Synge returned
again and again to Aran, to Kerry and to the Blaskets.
"He was a drifting, silent man, full of hidden passion,
and loved wild islands, because there, set out in the
light of day, he saw what lay hidden in himself."  He
liked to enter the houses of the people and sit
quietly listening to their talk.  In the dialect of Aran
"the cadence is long and meditative as befits the
thought of men who are much alone, and who, when
they meet in each other's houses&mdash;as is their way at
the day's end&mdash;listen patiently, each man speaking
in turn for some little time, and taking pleasure in
the vaguer meaning of the words and in their sounds.
Their thought, when not merely practical, is as full
of traditional wisdom and extravagant pictures as
some Aeschylean chorus."
</p>

<p>
Synge wrote down words and phrases wherever he
went, and found the Irish dialect so rich a thing that
he had begun translating into it fragments of the
great literatures of the world and had planned a
complete version of the <i>Imitation of Christ</i>.  He
attached great importance to the discovery of this
dramatic dialect.
</p>

<p>
In Synge's plays is not to be found any definite
philosophy; he was that rarest of things&mdash;a pure
artist.  "He loves all that has edge, all that is salt
in the mouth, all that is rough to the hand, all that
heightens the emotions by contrast, all that stings
into life the sense of tragedy."
</p>

<p>
All his plays, except the beautiful <i>Deirdre</i>, in which
he goes back to Irish legend for his plot, deal with
modern peasant life in Ireland, and range from the
rollicking comedy of the <i>Tinker's Wedding</i>, through
the irony of the <i>Playboy of the Western World</i>, and
the <i>Shadow of the Glen</i>, to the pure and magnificent
tragedy of <i>Riders to the Sea</i>.  I shall never forget
the impression made upon me by the latter play
when I saw it acted for the first time in the Abbey
Theatre in Dublin, acted as only the Irish players
can act it.  I have seen it often since, and never
without being deeply stirred, but that first performance
was a revelation and opened up a new world of
thought and feeling.
</p>

<p>
<i>Riders to the Sea</i> is a short, simple, one-act play,
taking, perhaps, twenty minutes to act; but in that
twenty minutes the spectator plunges deep into the
mystery and tragedy of life, before him black and
bottomless depths of suffering; he becomes aware
of Destiny hovering, a grim unseen presence, over
the little lives of men.  The background of the little
play is the vast remorseless sea, and over it broods
Eternity.

<h3>
DICKENS AND THACKERAY
</h3>

<p class="t3">
<i>An Essay found among Professor Bateman's early papers</i>
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
To attempt anything like an adequate discussion
of two literary giants like Dickens and Thackeray
in a short paper of this kind is like undertaking to
empty Niagara with a quart pot.  It is obvious
that I can hope to do no more than indicate in a
rather sketchy way some of the main points of
difference and resemblance in our two authors.  In
doing so I shall naturally pay somewhat more
attention to Dickens than to Thackeray.  With the
exception of <i>Esmond</i>, Thackeray's work is all very
much of the same kind, and displays a considerably
smaller degree of variety and versatility than that of
Dickens.  One requires less guidance for an
intelligent appreciation of Thackeray than for an
intelligent appreciation of Dickens.  The merits of
Thackeray's work are easily seen and easily defined;
a recognition of them is largely a matter of reason,
and can confidently be expected from any intelligent
reader.  But Dickens is an author much more difficult
to understand.  His faults as well as his merits are
gigantic; but then he frequently gets credit for
faults which are not there, and sometimes even some
of his greatest merits are construed as faults.  The
true appreciation of Dickens requires a larger exercise
of the imagination than in the case of Thackeray.
In other words, it is more a matter of feeling than
of reason.  Ask many a lover of Dickens to give a
reason for the faith that is in him, and he may find
it difficult to satisfy you.
</p>

<p>
Take, for example, Dickens's humorous characters.
There are some who cannot be got to admit that
Mr. Toots, Sim Tappertit, Sairey Gamp, and others
of that ilk are divinely humorous and inspired
creations; some will only admit that at best they
are but "excellent fooling"; others will even
characterize them as mere buffoonery.  It is an
inferior class of mind, however, which rejects the
abnormal merely on account of its abnormality, and
votes the improbable impossible, because it fails
to fit in with previously conceived ideas of right
and wrong.  Criticism is useless in the case of people
who hold such a view.  I may assert, with all the
force of which I am capable, that Mr. Toots is the
best thing in Dombey; that age cannot wither
Sairey Gamp any more than Cleopatra, and that she
will blossom in perennial freshness while the language
endures; but if you ask me for a reason, I can give
none.  It is no more possible to give a reason for
liking Sairey Gamp than for disliking Dr. Fell.  We
can enjoy with Thackeray the skilful dissection of a
character like that of Becky Sharp, and penetrate
with him the innermost recesses of her mighty little
soul; but Dickens himself could not have penetrated
the secret of the composition of Sairey Gamp.  In
her presence criticism is dumb.  We must be content
to stand in humble and reverent admiration and
satisfy ourselves with exclaiming, "Behold, it is
very good."  I shall return again to this point of
characterization, but I must now say something of
the position held by Dickens and Thackeray in the
historical development of the novel.
</p>

<p>
Though undoubtedly the two greatest novelists
of the Early Victorian school, Dickens and Thackeray
are alike in exercising very little apparent influence
on the development of the contemporary novel of
manners.  They both look back rather than forward.
They set the crown and consummation on the work
of the early eighteenth-century group of writers.
Dickens derives from Smollett, and Thackeray from
Fielding.  When Dickens as a boy discovered in an
old garret that precious pile of dusty eighteenth-century
books, <i>Peregrine Pickle, Humphrey Clinker</i>
and the rest, which he absorbed with such loving
eagerness, he little thought that he was destined
to be a second and a greater Smollett.
</p>

<p>
The characteristic type of English novel was defined
by Richardson, Fielding, and their school at the
beginning of the eighteenth century.  It aimed at a
dramatic representation of contemporary life and
manners; it took, in fact, the place of the drama as
the popular form of literature.  With the decay of
the Fielding novel came a reaction, and opposed
to the lusty and vivid realism of <i>Tom Jones</i> and
<i>Humphrey Clinker</i> we get the sham mediaevalism, the
dungeon-keeps, the echoing chambers, the hollow-voiced
spectres, and the absurd sentiment of Horace
Walpole's <i>Castle of Otranto</i>, and its imitators.  This
was a sort of side stream in the history of the novel,
which nevertheless created the taste for historical
romance, fed later by the novels of Scott.  Scott
stands apart from the main stream of English fiction,
though his style exercised an immense influence on
later novelists.  After the mediaeval relapse, the
contemporary novel of manners was continued at
the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the
nineteenth century by Fanny Burney and Jane
Austen.  The latter died in 1817; between 1814 and
1832 Scott's novels fill the field of fiction; and then,
between about 1835 and 1860, come Dickens and
Thackeray with their contemporaries, of whom
perhaps the most remarkable were Lytton and
Disraeli.  In none of these writers, however, must we
look for the foundation of the characteristic Victorian
novel&mdash;the novel of George Eliot and George Meredith.
The founder of that novel was Charlotte Brontë.
Her <i>Jane Eyre</i> and Thackeray's <i>Vanity Fair</i> were
published in the same year, 1848, and were reviewed
together in a famous number of the <i>Quarterly</i>.  The
two works represent two distinct schools of fiction.
Between the Dickens-Thackeray novel and the
Brontë-Eliot novel there is a great gulf fixed.  Dickens
and Thackeray stand out from their time like two
solitary giants.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps now it might be well to remind you briefly
of the main facts in the literary history of the two
men.  Dickens's first great work, <i>Pickwick</i>, appeared
in 1837, five years after the death of Scott.  It was
at once received with acclamation.  His next book,
<i>Oliver Twist</i>, though it must have come as a sort of
shock after <i>Pickwick</i>, did not stem the tide of
appreciation.  Like Oliver himself, every one was
soon asking for more.  They did not ask in vain.
During the next two decades, the forties and fifties,
Dickens poured forth novel after novel with surprising
rapidity.  Pickwick, Sam Weller, Fagin, Squeers,
Micawber soon became household words.  Dickens
won a popularity of which we can form no true
conception.  There has been nothing like it in our
time.  England and America were taken by storm;
even France was infected with the prevailing enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
During the days of Dickens' early popularity a
clever young man had been making a name for
himself as a humorist and satirist in the pages of
<i>Fraser's Magazine, Punch</i>, and similar journals.  This
was William Makepeace Thackeray.  In 1838, the
year after <i>Pickwick</i>, Thackeray began a series known
as the <i>Yellow Plush Papers</i>; during the next ten
years he produced a great variety of journalistic
work, short stories, sketches and essays, and wrote,
in addition, two satirical novels, <i>Catherine</i> and <i>Barry
Lyndon</i>.  In 1848 he burst on the world as a great
novelist with <i>Vanity Fair</i>, and within ten years more
he had published <i>Pendennis, Esmond, The Newcomes</i>,
and <i>The Virginians</i>.  This brings us up to 1859.
By that year Dickens had produced his best work;
Thackeray had only four more years to live; and
he was followed to the grave by Dickens in 1870.
From this account it is apparent that Dickens made
a much bigger stir than Thackeray in the contemporary
literary world.  He was the leviathan who
frolicked at will in the sea of popular appreciation.
Thackeray was a much smaller fish.
</p>

<p>
Considering Dickens and Thackeray first strictly
as novelists, we find a point of resemblance in the
fact that, from the point of view of form, they are
both uncommonly bad novelists.  A good novel,
like any other work of art, must have some unity
about it.  The incidents must not be bundled in
pell-mell, but must all contribute to the working out of
some central idea or situation.  Then we must have
an element of romance, and this ought to regulate
the subordination of the characters.  The characters
in every romance are essentially three, as Chesterton
puts it, St. George, the Princess, and the Dragon;
that is, St. George, something that loves and fights;
the Princess, something that is loved and fought for;
while the Dragon represents the opposition.  Other
characters besides these three there may and must be,
but they serve as mere machinery or scenery as far
as the romance is concerned.
</p>

<p>
Now let us consider the novels of Dickens and
Thackeray from these points of view.  As regards
incident they are almost wholly lacking in unity.
We cannot exactly deny them plots.  They develop
stories and interesting stories, but it is not an orderly
development.  Dickens strings his incidents together
almost haphazard, and so, to a large extent, does
Thackeray.  (By the way, in these remarks on
Thackeray I do not include <i>Esmond</i>, which is
magnificent, but is not really Thackeray.)
</p>

<p>
In the greater part of his writing Dickens had no
central aim or motive in view; he wrote, so to speak,
from hand to mouth.  Most of his books in fact were
written for periodicals in monthly parts, and it is
safe to say that nobody, and least of all Dickens
himself, knew exactly what a month would bring
forth.  I am here again speaking generally; there
are some exceptions, notably the <i>Tale of Two
Cities</i>&mdash;which stands almost as much apart from the rest
of Dickens's work as <i>Esmond</i> does from the rest of
Thackeray's&mdash;and the unfinished <i>Edwin Drood</i>.  Of
Thackeray we may say that he may have had some
central aim or motive in his novels, but if so, he paid
little attention to it, and did not allow it to impede
his rambling progress in the smallest degree.  We
may take it, then, as generally true that the novels
of Dickens and Thackeray are rough-hewn and
sometimes shapeless.  In the case of Dickens this
characteristic seldom annoys, but it is otherwise
with Thackeray.  I doubt, for example, if there is
anyone here who has read and enjoyed every word
of that fearfully digressive and dropsical novel,
<i>The Newcomes</i>.
</p>

<p>
Again, as regards characters, in neither novelist
do we get an orderly subordination.  Dickens,
perhaps, is the worst offender in this respect.  In
Thackeray, the hero and heroine are usually in a
sense the most important personages, though crowds
of personages who have really nothing to do with the
story bulk very largely, and though in <i>Vanity Fair</i>
there is no hero at all.  But in Dickens, the personages
who ought to be most important have frequently
very little to do with the novel.  As a rule, the leading
characters, hero, heroine, and villain, are lifeless and
uninteresting, and only serve to connect loosely a
great amount of strictly secondary matter.
</p>

<p>
The really important characters in Dickens are the
<i>unimportant</i> ones, those who are introduced <i>en
passant</i>, and who might as well be anywhere else
as far as the story is concerned.  In <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>
Nicholas himself does not interest me, neither does
his sister, neither do Madeline Bray and Mr. Bray,
neither does Ralph Nickleby.  The people who do
interest me are people like Mrs. Nickleby, Mantalini,
the Squeers family, the Kenwigs, and Vincent
Crummies.  In <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> the least important
character is Martin himself, but his life serves as a
string upon which are hung Pecksniff, Todger's
Boarding House and all that therein was, Chevy
Slime, Esq., Sairey Gamp, Betsy Prigg, Mr. Mould,
Elijah Pogram, and many others in whose company
there is endless delight.  All these, however, might
just as well have been hung on the string of <i>Nicholas
Nickleby</i> or <i>David Copperfield</i> or <i>Bleak House</i> or
almost any of the other books.  Similarly all through.
In <i>Dombey</i> Florence is a nonentity, Walter Gay is a
nonentity, Dombey himself is a "made character,"
well-made, but not created.  In <i>David Copperfield</i>
David begins by being a reality, but tails off into an
abstraction.  In <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> Darnay does
not exist, and Lucie Manette only barely exists.
In both Dickens and Thackeray, in fact, the romantic
element is really subordinate, in Dickens very much
so; and in neither writer do St. George, the Princess,
and the Dragon ever become all-important.  Both
writers, in fact, are to be judged piece-meal, as
creators of situations and characters, rather than
in the bulk as creators of novels.
</p>

<p>
The keynote of the work of both our authors was
struck in two of their first works of any note.  In 1848
Thackeray published in <i>Punch</i> the series of papers
entitled the <i>Book of Snobs</i>, which marks his dedication
to the especial task of unmasking the pretence and
sham which underlay the whole of English public
and private life.  His definition of the word <i>snob</i> was
comprehensive.  "The snob," says Thackeray, "is a
child of aristocratical societies.  Perched on his step
of the long social ladder, he respects the man on the
step above and despises the man on the step below,
without enquiring what they are worth, solely on
account of their position; in his innermost heart
he finds it natural to kiss the boots of the first, and to
kick the second."  Starting with this definition,
Thackeray lashed unsparingly all classes of society
from the highest to the lowest.  He discovered and
unmasked snobs of all descriptions, church snobs,
military snobs, literary snobs, country snobs, political
snobs, Continental snobs.  In this book Thackeray
appears as the caustic satirist of every sort of social
hypocrisy, and this character he maintains in his
novels.  <i>Pendennis, Vanity Fair</i>, and <i>The Newcomes</i>
are largely <i>Books of Snobs</i> worked into the form of
novels.
</p>

<p>
Dickens's first important work was his <i>Sketches by
Boz</i>, a series of papers in which he describes various
aspects and phases of the life of the English lower
middle class.  Though somewhat crude in style and
occasionally even vulgar in tone, these papers are
seldom completely commonplace, and many of the
characteristics of the mature Dickens can be discerned
there in embryo.  They have a distinction of manner
and a suggestion of creative power which is
unmistakable, and they mark the dedication of Dickens to
his especial task, the sympathetic though exaggerated
painting of the poorer middle classes.  While
Thackeray took his stand on the universal sham and
corruption of our social system, lashing hypocrisy
and showing up the rottenness which lay hidden
beneath the whited sepulchres of society, Dickens
revealed the treasures which were buried beneath
the rubbish-heap designated as the "poorer middle
classes."  Just as Thackeray's novels are glorified
<i>Books of Snobs</i>, so Dickens's novels are, for the most
part, glorified <i>Sketches by Boz</i>.  His early works,
though called novels, are undisguisedly a series of
sketches loosely strung together.  <i>Pickwick</i>, of
course, is absolutely episodic.  It was begun to supply
the letterpress to a series of drawings by a popular
artist, and when Dickens commenced he had no aim
except to get his characters into such amusing
situations as would afford scope to the illustrator.  As
the book goes on, however, it begins to get hold of
Dickens, and the change is seen especially in the
character of Pickwick, who begins as an elderly
crank about whom Dickens does not care a jot, but
develops into one of the most lovable old gentlemen
of fiction.  However, the fact remains that <i>Pickwick</i>
has not the remotest vestige of a plot, and can by no
stretch of the imagination be called a novel.  Again,
<i>Oliver Twist</i>, as Chesterton remarks, is really not a
novel, and might, without losing much, have been
published as a series of papers entitled <i>The Workhouse,
A Thieves' Den</i>, and so on.  <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> might
similarly have been published as a series of papers
entitled <i>A Yorkshire School, A Provincial Theatre</i>,
and so on.  The fact that all these sketches are
strung together on the lives of those shadowy
personages Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickleby does
not at all affect their real character.  After <i>Nicholas
Nickleby</i> the books begin to lose, to some extent, this
sketchiness, that is, the episodes are more closely
and skilfully interwoven into a connected whole,
but still Dickens, the novelist, never quite emerges
from Boz, the essayist.
</p>

<p>
These remarks about Dickens naturally lead me
to say something about the development of our two
authors.  About Thackeray I cannot say very much.
By the time he emerges from the undercurrent of
journalistic work, all the essentials of the mature
Thackeray seem almost fully developed.  <i>Barry
Lyndon</i> is almost as mature in style as <i>Vanity Fair</i>.
<i>Vanity Fair</i> itself, Thackeray's first work of
importance, is also his greatest work.  That is, instead of
working up to a climax as a novelist, Thackeray
began at the top and worked downwards.  Of course,
we must remember that when he wrote it he had
reached the age of thirty-seven.  The subsequent
novels, with the exception of <i>Esmond</i>, mark a
deterioration, and not an advance.
</p>

<p>
I must here make a slight digression to speak of
<i>Esmond</i>.  Into this brilliant historical patch
Thackeray threw all his great knowledge of, and
love for, the eighteenth century.  He was soaked in
eighteenth-century literature and history&mdash;witness
his <i>Four Georges</i> and <i>English Humourists</i>; and in
<i>Esmond</i> he assumed with consummate skill the
eighteenth-century manner.
</p>

<p>
In this novel Thackeray casts off completely his
mask of cynicism, and appears as a man of noble
feeling and deep sympathy, who could write a
polished, pure, and straightforward English style.
We feel, however, that the book is after all only a
brilliant freak, and that the real Thackeray is the
cynical, the satirical, and the caustic Thackeray of
<i>Vanity Fair</i>.  <i>Esmond</i> stands to the rest of
Thackeray's work somewhat in the relation of <i>Romola</i> to
George Eliot's other novels.  In both the atmosphere
is artificial, the result of long and careful study,
and in both the deception is so perfect that the
artificiality is almost impossible to detect.  In two
of his novels Dickens took historical subjects, namely
in <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> and the <i>Tale of Two Cities</i>.  The
latter is the acme of Dickens's attainments in the
descriptive style, and is perhaps more restrained and
artistic than any of his other works.  In brilliant
imagination and vivid representation of an historical
phase he more than equals Thackeray, though his
novel falls short of <i>Esmond</i> in characterization.
Esmond, Beatrix, and Lady Castlewood are much
better than Darnay, Lucie, and the Doctor, though
Sidney Carton, perhaps, is as fine as anything in
Thackeray.
</p>

<p>
To return to the question of development, we may
say that Thackeray's style was fully developed during
his career as a journalist, essayist, and writer of short
stories, and that we find its culminating point in
<i>Vanity Fair</i>.
</p>

<p>
In the case of Dickens, however, we can trace a
well-marked, if rapid, advance.  <i>Sketches by Boz</i> are
distinctly crude.  <i>Pickwick Papers</i> are a startling
advance on one side of Dickens's art.  We find in
them the vigour, versatility, and exuberance of a
youthful and tremendous imagination.  They
display inexhaustible resource and gigantic humour.
Dickens lavished enough genius on them to do ten
ordinary men for a lifetime, and yet he did it with
perfect ease.  We feel that he enjoyed himself in
writing them, that he revelled in the task.  Every
character, down to the smallest, lives.  Mr. John
Swanker and Mr. Cyrus Bantam, for example, are
as real to us as Mr. Sam Weller and Mr. Pickwick.
Pickwick is one of the greatest of humorous portraits
in literature.  It is as great as the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>.
It is wonderful that a young writer who in <i>Sketches
by Boz</i> had only been feeling his way should, at one
bound, reach the height of excellence which we find
in <i>Pickwick</i>.  The incidents are commonplace enough.
The jokes are the sort of jokes which are still the
stock-in-trade of the ha'penny comic&mdash;jokes about
mothers-in-law, red-nosed curates, and falling on
the ice, about getting drunk, and fighting, and fatness,
and sitting upon one's hat.  But what a difference
between the treatment of Dickens and that of the
uninspired humorists.
</p>

<p>
<i>Pickwick</i>, however, as I have said, represents only
one side of Dickens's art, but perhaps the greatest
side, the humorous delineation of character.  There
is as yet no trace of Dickens the novelist (for by no
stretch of the imagination can <i>Pickwick</i> be called
a novel), of Dickens the master of pathos, of Dickens
the descriptive artist.  There is, however, to be found
in <i>Pickwick</i> traces of a youthful phase in Dickens's
character, a somewhat morbid leaning towards the
horrible and criminal, afterwards toned down and
corrected by his strong common sense, but never
wholly absent.  This trait is to be found in some of
the short stories inserted in <i>Pickwick</i>, notably <i>The
Madman's Tale</i>.  The latter story might have served
as a warning to some very discerning critic of the
startling change to be found in Dickens's next book,
<i>Oliver Twist</i>.  In this work the lavish humour of
<i>Pickwick</i> dwindles down to very small proportions,
and is decidedly overweighed by the horrible and
morbid.  The murder of Nancy and the death of
Bill Sykes are only equalled for vivid awfulness a
couple of times in Dickens's later books, notably in
<i>Bleak House</i> and in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>.  In <i>Oliver
Twist</i> appears a new element which was to take a
prominent place in Dickens's future work, the element
of social reform.  Social reform had already produced
the workhouse.  Dickens started his reform by attacking
the workhouse.  But Dickens is not yet a novelist.
The romantic element is absent in <i>Oliver Twist</i>; the
hero is only a child.
</p>

<p>
It was in his fourth book, <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>, that
we find Dickens definitely deciding to write romance.
Accordingly he introduces an impossibly good
St. George, throws in a Princess and a Dragon half-way
through for his benefit, and tries to make an orthodox
novel.  He succeeds, however, in making only a very
poor imitation of one.  Nicholas himself is a
hopelessly badly-drawn character; and in fact nearly
everywhere in the story that Dickens tries to be
definitely romantic and orthodox he sinks below
the level of the ha'penny novelette.
</p>

<p>
In his next book, <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i> (1840),
he almost abandons his good intentions formed with
<i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>, and we return to the realm of
sketches and sketchiness.  He is progressing, however,
in the use of forcible and restrained language.
<i>Barnaby Rudge</i> (1841) is splendid of its kind, the best
bit of actual writing Dickens had yet done, though
it is rather a series of brilliant pictures than an
orthodox novel.  The hero is an idiot, but nevertheless
not so idiotic as was Nicholas Nickleby.  In <i>Martin
Chuzzlewit</i> (1844) we get an attempt at romance.
Martin is a hero a little more life-like than the
much-abused Nicholas.  In this book Dickens's powers of
satire come out at their best in his pictures of
American society, and his power of humorous characterization
is also at its height in Pecksniff, Sairey Gamp,
and many of the minor characters.  The
melodramatic side of Dickens's art unfortunately comes
out unpleasantly strong in the description of old
Chuzzlewit and his hopeful son, Jonas.  At this
point all Dickens's characteristic traits may be said
to be fully developed.  From this time, except in
<i>David Copperfield</i>, which marks the culmination of
his powers, and in the <i>Tale of Two Cities</i>, there is a
distinct decline.  <i>Dombey</i> is in parts magnificent,
but a sort of gloom hangs over most of the book,
relieved only by such bright patches as Mr. Toots,
Bunsby, and Susan Nipper.  Major Bagstock is the
most unpleasant of Dickens's humorous characters.
In this novel Dickens trespassed on Thackeray's
preserves with disastrous results.  His attempted
satire on fashionable society and fashionable
marriages, in the Cleopatra-Edith-Carker episodes,
should be compared with Thackeray's treatment
of a similar subject in <i>The Newcomes</i>.  Still, there is
nothing crude about the style of <i>Dombey</i>; it has the
strength and force of maturity.  After <i>David
Copperfield</i>, which is known and loved by every one, and
which is the most purely natural and wholly lovable
of Dickens's books, we get a series of what may be
called splendid failures in <i>Bleak House, Little Dorrit,
Hard Times, Our Mutual Friend</i>, and <i>Great
Expectations</i>.  They all contain magnificent patches, but
they fail to impress one like the earlier books.  It is
some time now since I read <i>Bleak House</i>, and I must
say I have very faint recollections of the greater
part of it, whereas the earlier works are unforgettable.
</p>

<p>
Proceeding now to a consideration of Dickens and
Thackeray as humorists, we may say, in a general
way, that Thackeray's humour is largely incidental
to his style, whereas the humour is the very root and
groundwork of Dickens's best and most characteristic
writing.  It is difficult to define humour, but it seems
to me that it consists, to a considerable extent, in
an unexpected overthrow of the strictly logical.
Mr. Micawber, the weak and foolish, the obvious
failure in life, logically ought to be the most despairing
and miserable of men.  The fact, however, that so
far from harbouring self-contempt, Mr. Micawber
has a self-confidence which nothing can destroy, and
that so far from retiring with disgust from a world
which offers him nothing but kicks, he has the most
childlike faith in his ultimate acquirement of
unlimited halfpence, strikes us as being such a curious
and blessed reversal of the logical order of things
that we are pleased with Mr. Micawber.  Instead of
despising him, we love him.  Micawber is undoubtedly
a fool.  Nearly all Dickens's great characters are
fools.  They are persons whom we should avoid in
real life; but the gospel of Dickens, as Chesterton
says, "is to suffer fools gladly."  "Every instant we
neglect a great fool merely because he is foolish.
Every day we neglect Tootses and Swivellers, Guppys
and Joblings.  Every day we are missing a monster
whom we might love, and an imbecile whom we
should certainly admire."  The humour of Dickens
took the failures of life and turned them into successes.
True humour is seldom far separated from pathos,
and with Dickens, even while we laugh, we pity and
we love.  With Thackeray we laugh, but as a rule
we do not love nor pity, we despise.  The element
of pathos is in general absent from Thackeray's
humour; hence it is not really true humour at all;
it is an inverted way of looking at things which
strikes us as being funny.  But the critic is always
with Thackeray, hidden beneath the humorist.  It is
impossible for him to produce a lovable fool, for it is
impossible for him to conceal the fact that he knows
his character is a fool, and despises him accordingly.
Take Jos. Sedley in <i>Vanity Fair</i>.  The big Anglo-Indian
was just the stuff of which a good Dickens's
character is made.  He is just the right sort of fool.
But Thackeray goes out of his way to make him as
contemptible as he is laughable, and in the end we are
extremely glad to be rid of Mr. Jos.
</p>

<p>
In other words, with Thackeray the humour is
nearly always overweighed by the satire.  Thackeray
is always considered as a satirist <i>par excellence</i>.  But
Dickens also is a satirist of another and perhaps
a more effective kind.  Thackeray's satire is the keen,
cold, pitiless dissection of a surgeon.  He lays bare
every motive, every contemptible little spring of
action.  He tries, indeed, by his humorous manner
to convince us that he is not all the time desperately
in earnest, but behind it all we feel the preacher
warning us, holding up examples for us, imploring us
not to be or do likewise.  In the character of
Mr. Osborne, for example, we have the city magnate,
self-made and able, but the slave of money.  He is
under the impression that money can make up for
the vulgarity and coarseness of which he is vaguely
conscious.  When poor Sedley, his old friend, is
broken, he casts him off without pity; along with
Sedley's money, all his value in Osborne's eyes had
disappeared.  The latter lavished his wealth in trying
to make his son a gentleman, and the result is that
miserable cad, George Osborne, who despises his
father, disappoints his wishes out of obstinacy,
marries Amelia out of bravado, tires of her and
proceeds to flirt with Becky Sharp, and dies a hero's
death at Waterloo because he cannot help himself.
Thackeray shows it all up without mercy, and he is
always showing up similar things in great profusion.
His satire depends largely for its effect on his <i>manner</i>.
He conceals from us his indignation and contempt for
the vices he describes, and writes of them carelessly,
almost flippantly, as if they were the most natural
things in the world.  This is another effect gained
by the reversal of the logical.  But is such satire
effective?  I doubt it.  I doubt that all Thackeray's
analysis of the vice and rottenness of fashionable
society ever turned one sinner from the evil of his
ways.  People do not mind being shown up, although
they hate to be made ridiculous.  Now Dickens's
method of satirizing was to make the objects which he
attacked ridiculous.  He took the weak points of a
man or an institution, carried them to extremes and
showed their logical absurdity.  When people saw
in the person of Bumble what workhouse beadles
were&mdash;not bad, not vicious&mdash;but absurd institutions,
they desired to get rid of them.  Dickens might have
abused Yorkshire schools till he was blue in the face,
have analysed and shown up their weak points, and
written to the papers, and yet might have done little
good.  Instead, he drew Squeers, and while people
laughed consumedly, they also made a mental note
that such persons as Squeers were an absurd blot on
our social system and should forthwith be abolished.
When Dickens wished to satirize America, he did not
make an exhaustive analysis of the American system.
He simply accepted its absurdities, exaggerated
them to the utmost limit, embodied them in Elijah
Pogram, Jefferson Brick, and their fellows, and drew
a crushing satirical picture of a state of society eaten
up with self-conceit.  When a man beholds his natural
face in a distorting mirror, he is not quite so pleased
with himself as before; and when the Americans
beheld themselves in the mirror of <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>
they were not pleased either.  If Thackeray had
taken on himself to analyse and expose their moral
corruption, they would probably have felt flattered.
Dickens's method of satire was the <i>reductio ad
absurdum</i>, and appealed to the imagination.  Further,
Thackeray's satire was generally aimed at individuals
and had for its object moral reform.  We must admit,
however, in favour of Thackeray's method that it
produced brilliant, consistent, and life-like pictures
of society such as Dickens was wholly incapable of
drawing.  If you want real life, go to Thackeray;
but if you wish to get out of this world for a while,
and take a short holiday in another and a more
pleasant world, go to Dickens.  I hope no one will
think that I am here belittling the genius of Thackeray.
<i>Vanity Fair</i> will ever stand as one of the most brilliant
works of fiction in the language.  It is more
consistently good than anything Dickens ever did.  As a
humorous and, at the same time, dreadfully caustic
picture of society it is incomparable.  In breadth of
view and variety of incident it rivals <i>Tom Jones</i>; in
minute observation of detail it reminds one of Jane Austen.
</p>

<p>
It is as a creator of character that, in my opinion,
Dickens has his greatest advantage over Thackeray.
The man who maintains that Dickens is a genius
of the first order must be finally driven to take his
stand on Dickens's characters.  Thackeray's characters
are photographic; they are excellent copies of life.
Yet, admirable as many of them are, we can never
quite get away from the suspicion that they were
made for a purpose.  Thackeray takes them to pieces
with such skill that we are half inclined to think that
he also puts them together.  But Dickens's characters
are pure creatures of the imagination.  They are not
studies of, but splendid additions to, the human race.
Dickens does not analyse their motives, and could
not if he would.  He describes them, and we feel that
they are alive.  The very smallest of them is indelibly
impressed on our imagination.  Dickens conquered
Thackeray completely in his minor characters.  I
have read <i>The Newcomes</i> recently, for example, but
I have no clear idea of the distinction between
Mrs. Brian Newcome and Mrs. Hobson Newcome; I have
read <i>Chuzzlewit</i> less recently, but I am quite clear
about Mr. Chevy Slime and Mr. Tigg.
</p>

<p>
Thackeray produced a tremendous variety of
characters, but the large majority of them, I should
say, are unpleasant.  Thackeray, when all is said
and done, was first and last a moralist; and it was
his aim as a moralist to make his characters
unpleasant.  There are few lovable characters in
<i>Pendennis</i>; there are none in <i>Vanity Fair</i>.  The few
respectable characters are all figure-heads, and as
for the remainder, if it were not for the humour and
dramatic force with which they are pictured to us,
the description of such people as Becky Sharp, Sir
Pitt Crawley, Lord Steyne, and Jos. Sedley could give
little pleasure.  As it is, one feels that outside the
pages of Thackeray one would give a good deal to
avoid meeting them.  But who would not give his
dearest possession for the privilege of beholding in
the flesh Sam Weller, Mr. Micawber, Sairey Gamp,
Mr. Dick, and even such unmitigated scoundrels as
Jingle and Squeers.  There are in Dickens many sorts of
characters, but only one sort is great&mdash;the characters
whom Dickens himself found amusing.  The characters
he admired, such as Nicholas, are wooden; the
characters he hated are too hateful; but the
characters, whether pleasant or unpleasant, in whom he
found something amusing are all at least interesting.
Those whom he found amusing and at the same
time lovable are his greatest characters.
</p>

<p>
The persons in Dickens's pages whom I call his
<i>great</i> characters are frequently accused of being
impossible.  You might as well say that a
hippopotamus or a duck-billed platypus is impossible
because it does not suit your ideas of what is right
and proper.  The existence of the hippopotamus
is its justification, and it is so also with a Dickens
character.  It is obviously not copied, nor is it a
mere abstraction.  It is vividly alive.  <i>You</i> could
not have created it, and you know that nobody else
but Dickens could.  I think it quite possible that a
very clever man might produce a Colonel Newcome,
or a Blanche Amory, or even a Becky Sharp; but
I assert that no one but Dickens could produce a
Sairey Gamp or a Mr. Toots, and that nobody would
be mad enough to try.
</p>

<p>
Dickens's characters are improbable, that I grant
you.  But any man with a marked individuality is
improbable.  It is all the people in the world to one
against his being what he is.  Dickens's characters
are just a little more improbable, that is all.  Dickens's
work is called by Chesterton rather mythology than
history or fiction, the mythology of the lower middle
class.  Micawber and Pecksniff, like Falstaff and
Lear, Hector and Achilles, are immortal realities,
an undying possession of humanity.  Their alleged
<i>impossibility</i> is, in fact, their passport to immortality.
Thackeray's exact copies of life may grow faded
and out of date; but Dickens's creations will never
be any more impossible than when he created them.
They will never be too impossible for our acceptance.
The glories of a Toots and a Swiveller were veiled
from the eyes of Thackeray.  If he could have
conceived such characters, he would have exposed their
weaknesses (an easy task), and covered them with
ridicule and contempt.  But as depicted by the
kindly hand of Dickens, who is not ready to own them
as fellow creatures and admit that they are lovable?
</p>

<p>
The mention of Pecksniff reminds me that Dickens
is sometimes accused of merely attaching a label to
his characters, of making them living embodiments
of some trait or peculiarity; in other words, that
Dickens, like Ben Jonson, made his characters mere
illustrations of some particular humour.  Thus Mark
Tapley may be designated by the word "jolly,"
Micawber will always be "hoping for something to
turn up," Pecksniff will always be playing the
hypocrite.  But though Pecksniff is first and foremost
a hypocrite, and though Dickens's purpose is
undoubtedly to impress on us and exaggerate his
hypocrisy, he has all the other essentials of a human
being.  He can, for example, get drunk.  Let me
read a few extracts from that marvellous scene from
<i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> when Mr. Pecksniff gets tipsy at
Todgers' Boarding House.  If any one, after reading
it, can still assert that it is an abstraction or impossible,
I give him up in despair.
</p>

<p>
The gentlemen, after the toasts have been drunk,
rejoin the ladies:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
Mr. Pecksniff had followed his younger friends up-stairs
and taken a chair at the side of Mrs. Todgers.  He had also
spilt a cup of coffee over his legs without appearing to be
aware of the circumstance; nor did he seem to know that
there was muffin on his knee.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"And how have they used you down-stairs, sir?" asked
the hostess.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Their conduct has been such, my dear madam," said
Mr. Pecksniff, "as I can never think of without emotion, or
remember without a tear.  Oh, Mrs. Todgers!"
</p>

<p class="quote">
"My goodness!" exclaimed the lady.  "How low you are
in your spirits, sir!"
</p>

<p class="quote">
"I am a man, my dear madam," said Mr. Pecksniff,
shedding tears, and speaking with an imperfect articulation,
"but I am also a father.  I am also a widower.  My feelings,
Mrs. Todgers, will not consent to be entirely smothered,
like the young children in the Tower.  They are grown up,
and the more I press the bolster on them, the more they
look round the corner of it."
</p>

<p class="quote">
He suddenly became conscious of the bit of muffin, and
stared at it intently: shaking his head the while, in a forlorn
and imbecile manner, as if he regarded it as his evil genius,
and mildly reproached it.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"She was beautiful, Mrs. Todgers," he said, turning his
glazed eye again upon her, without the least preliminary
notice.  "She had a small property."
</p>

<p class="quote">
"So I have heard," said Mrs. Todgers with great sympathy.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Those are her daughters," said Mr. Pecksniff, pointing
out the young ladies, with increased emotion.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Mrs. Todgers had no doubt about it.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Mercy and Charity," said Mr. Pecksniff, "Charity and
Mercy.  Not unholy names, I hope?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Mr. Pecksniff!" cried Mrs. Todgers.  "What a ghastly
smile!  Are you ill, sir?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
He pressed his hand upon her arm, and answered in a
solemn manner, and a faint voice, "Chronic."
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Chronic?" cried the frightened Mrs. Todgers.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Chron-ic," he repeated with some difficulty.  "Chronic.
A chronic disorder.  I have been its victim from childhood.
It is carrying me to my grave."
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Heaven forbid!" cried Mrs. Todgers.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Yes, it is," said Mr. Pecksniff, reckless with despair.
"I am rather glad of it, upon the whole.  You are like her,
Mrs. Todgers."
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Don't squeeze me so tight, pray, Mr. Pecksniff.  If any
of the gentlemen should notice us."
</p>

<p class="quote">
"For her sake," said Mr. Pecksniff.  "Permit me.  In
honour of her memory.  For the sake of a voice from the
tomb.  You are <i>very</i> like her, Mrs. Todgers!  What a world
this is!"
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Ah!  Indeed you may say that!" cried Mrs. Todgers.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"I am afraid it is a vain and thoughtless world," said
Mr. Pecksniff, overflowing with despondency.  "These young
people about us.  Oh! what sense have they of their
responsibilities?  None.  Give me your other hand, Mrs. Todgers."
</p>

<p class="quote">
The lady hesitated, and said "she didn't like."
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Has a voice from the grave no influence?" said
Mr. Pecksniff with dismal tenderness.  "This is irreligious!
My dear creature."
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Hush!" urged Mrs. Todgers.  "Really you mustn't."
</p>

<p class="quote">
"It's not me," said Mr. Pecksniff.  "Don't suppose it's
me: it's the voice; it's her voice."
</p>

<p class="quote">
Mrs. Pecksniff, deceased, must have had an unusually
thick and husky voice for a lady, and rather a stuttering
voice, and to say the truth somewhat of a drunken voice, if
it had ever borne much resemblance to that in which
Mr. Pecksniff spoke just then.  But perhaps this was delusion
on his part.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"It has been a day of enjoyment, Mrs. Todgers, but still
it has been a day of torture.  It has reminded me of my
loneliness.  What am I in the world?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
"An excellent gentleman, Mr. Pecksniff," said Mrs. Todgers.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"There is consolation in that too," cried Mr. Pecksniff.
"Am I?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
"There is no better man living," said Mrs. Todgers, "I
am sure."
</p>

<p class="quote">
Mr. Pecksniff smiled through his tears, and slightly shook
his head....  "Chronic&mdash;chronic!  Let's have a little drop
of something to drink."
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Bless my life, Miss Pecksniffs!" cried Mrs. Todgers,
aloud, "your dear pa 's took very poorly!"
</p>

<p class="quote">
Mr. Pecksniff straightened himself by a surprising effort,
as every one turned hastily towards him; and standing on
his feet, regarded the assembly with a look of ineffable
wisdom.  Gradually it gave place to a smile; a feeble,
helpless, melancholy smile; bland almost to sickliness.  "Do
not repine, my friends," said Mr. Pecksniff, tenderly.  "Do
not weep for me.  It is chronic."  And with these words,
after making a futile attempt to pull off his shoes, he fell into
the fireplace.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In conclusion, I am sorry that I have not time to
discuss the actual style of our two writers.  I had
hoped to dwell a little on Dickens's descriptive power,
in which he far excels Thackeray; on that wonderful
photographic imagination of his which impresses on
our minds the scenery of his novels down to the
smallest details as vividly as it was impressed on
his own, on his splendid handling of crowds and big
stage effects.  I am afraid that in the foregoing
remarks I have dwelt too much on Dickens's strong
points; I have said nothing of his cheap melodrama,
his maudlin pathos, his frequent bad taste; but
after all, these are but comparatively small blots on
a great genius, and they nearly always occur where
Dickens is trying to impress us in a way that does
not come naturally to him.  I am afraid, also, that
I have emphasized mainly Thackeray's weak points
and neglected his strong ones.  I set off, however,
avowedly as a champion of Dickens, and I should
find it hard to pose as an impartial judge, for while
I only admire Thackeray, I love Dickens.

<h3>
BRAINS AND INTELLECT
</h3>

<p class="t3">
<i>A fugitive production&mdash;occasion unknown</i>
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Accepting the well-known dictum of Appius
Claudius that the government is the belly of
the body-politic, and the general mob of citizens
"the limbs and outward flourishes," what section of
the community, shall we say, constitutes the brains?
We might, at first, be inclined to assign the role of
"brains" to those members of the community who
are particularly occupied with the pursuit of learning,
such as, for example (to take a large and
representative class), University professors.  A little
reflection, however, suffices to show that we should
be mistaken.  The men who are usually spoken of
as the "brains of the community" are of a very
different type from University professors.  They are
men who maintain fair round bellies and expansive
watch chains, who ride in automobiles and smoke
imposing cigars.  Clearly, University professors are
not in this class.
</p>

<p>
Where, then, shall we place those members of the
community who make the pursuit of knowledge for
its own sake their chief occupation?  It may help us
towards the solution of this weighty problem if we
make a distinction between brains and intellect,
and call such people as professors, philosophers, and
poets the "intellect" of the community.  We shall
then have to define clearly what we mean by "brains,"
and what we mean by "intellect."
</p>

<p>
"Brains" are what a man uses when he has some
practical end in view, such as more money in his
pocket, better food to eat, better clothes to wear;
"intellect" deals with problems (usually classed as
"academic") which have no immediate commercial
value&mdash;such as whether the sun goes round the
earth or the earth round the sun, or why an apple
falls to the ground.  "Brains" are generally admired,
because everybody can see the results which they
achieve; "intellect" is usually treated with neglect
or indifference because it works in a sphere which is
far out of range of the common vision.
</p>

<p>
What, then, is the justification for the maintenance
in a community of a purely intellectual class of people,
occupied with problems which have nothing to do
with actual life, and which apparently contribute
nothing to the common stock of "useful" knowledge,
the kind of knowledge that can be turned into money.
Why, for example, do we maintain at great expense
in our universities professors of literature, philosophy,
and pure science to devote their time to the study of
merely academic problems, and to teach our sons
and daughters such a smattering of these things as is
of no practical use to them whatever, and which
causes most of them a good deal of trouble and annoyance?
</p>

<p>
It is easy to understand why we should maintain
professors of such subjects as engineering, dentistry,
and agriculture, for engines and teeth are both things
that will not allow themselves to be neglected, and
it is undoubtedly a good thing to make two blades
of grass grow where only one grew before.  But why
should a man be afraid to devote his time to making
an appreciation of Greek tragedy grow where none
grew before, or to try to arouse an interest in such a
problem as the psychology of metre.
</p>

<p>
It may be argued, of course, that University
professors provide a good deal of amusement for
their students, that their personal peculiarities,
carefully observed through four years of class-room
work, often furnish rich entertainment at convivial
gatherings.  Or, again, it may be urged that the
study of professors (in so far as professors can be
regarded as human) is the study of human nature,
and that students who observe their professors
carefully are gaining an acquaintance with a practical
branch of the science of anthropology.  But neither
of these answers to our question can be regarded as
wholly satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
Let us consider briefly the function of intellect in
the individual, and see if it will throw any light on
the function of the intellectual class in the community.
When intellect is developed at all in the average
citizen, its sole function seems to be to make him
either uncomfortable or objectionable.  For suppose
a small puny growth of intellect does appear in a man,
it generally has one of two effects; either it makes
him <i>dissatisfied</i> with himself, troubled with vague
yearnings after a higher life, worried with misgivings
on religious questions, annoyed by the feeling that
he ought to be able to enjoy books and pictures and
music which afford him no real enjoyment; or, he
becomes abnormally <i>satisfied</i> with himself, propounds
half-baked theories of the universe, teems with
criticisms of books which he has not read or does not
understand, or bubbles over with solutions of
problems upon which he has never seriously pondered.
</p>

<p>
The one thing that such men can seldom be got
to do is to set to work to develop that little growth
of intellect, to feed and nourish it by the study of
literature and philosophy, so that they may at last
be enabled to think out problems for themselves, or
at least to appreciate intelligently the solutions of
them which great thinkers have placed on record.
When, oh when, will men understand that intellectual
things are not an amusement nor a hobby, to be
taken up as a side-line in one's spare time, but that
the appreciation of the things of the intellect is the
reward of the most difficult and baffling of all kinds
of labour; that one will appreciate Plato or Sophocles,
Shakespeare or Milton, Descartes or Newton, precisely
in proportion to the distance which one has climbed
along the rugged path which leads to the intellectual
peaks upon which those giants of thought sit eternally
throned, that the cultivation of the intellect is not
the work of four years or forty years, but of a lifetime,
nay, of many lifetimes?
</p>

<p class="poem">
To spend uncounted years of pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, again, and yet again,<br />
In working out in heart and brain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of our being here,<br />
To gather facts from far and near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the mind to hold them clear<br />
And knowing more may yet appear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto one's latest breath to fear,<br />
The premature result to draw&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the object, end and law,<br />
And purpose of our being here?<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
asks Clough, and to this question all our greatest
thinkers have answered&mdash;Yes.
</p>

<p>
It is the few who are convinced of the value and
seriousness of intellectual things, and who do not
flinch from the self-sacrifice and apparently fruitless
labour which the pursuit of such things involves,
that humanity as a whole owes its progress.  If it
were not for these men, whom Bunyan would call
the intellectual Greathearts of the community, we
should still, as a race, be sunk in barbarism.  Intellect
in the average man is allowed to atrophy; in the
small percentage who strive after culture it
accomplishes nothing of value, but it is the latter people
who form the rank and file of the intellectual army.
Gradually, little by little, that army is advancing;.
every now and then some great general appears&mdash;a
Plato, a Shakespeare, a Newton, a Kant, a Darwin&mdash;and
under his leadership a victory is won; now
this outpost of the hosts of darkness is captured, now
that, and the flag of the human intellect is raised
upon its ramparts.  Meanwhile, the mass of mankind
trudges on heavily, often two or three centuries
behind.  Next arrive the inventors, the reformers,
the men of constructive intellect, who take the results
of the great thinkers and plan their application to
life; and lastly come the men of "brains" in their
fur coats and fair round bellies, promote their
companies, organize their industries, make their political
speeches, and finally gather in the shekels, and also
most of the honour and glory.  By this time the
intellectual army is again far ahead, attacking the
next outpost of the kingdom of chaos and Old Night.
And so humanity moves onward and upward.
</p>

<p>
What, then, is the function of the academic class
in the community?  Simply to keep the flag of human
intellect flying, a work which, in most cases, involves
some self-sacrifice in those who devote themselves
to it.  A professor, for example, though a man of
intellect, is not necessarily devoid of brains, and he
might well turn those brains to advantage in some
more lucrative profession.  As it is, he is compelled to
a large extent to sacrifice his individuality, to degrade
his intellect with drudgery which is beneath it, to
stand as a mere intermediary or conduit-pipe between
the student and knowledge.  At the same time, if,
out of the hundreds of students who pass through
his hands in one academic year, he succeeds in
inspiring even a single individual with a true desire for
culture, his existence for that year is fully justified,
for has he not added one member to the band of
intellectual pioneers who will finally, we hope, take
possession, in the name of humanity, of the whole
universe of thought?

<h3>
THE WAR
</h3>

<p class="intro">
<i>This address, which aroused much criticism in the press, is
compiled from a newspaper report and some notes found among
Professor Bateman's papers.  It is probably incomplete, but is
included because of the interest attaching to it.</i>
</p>

<p class="intro">
<i>The address was delivered before the University Y.M.C.A. on
Sunday, 25 October 1914, on the eve of the departure of
Professor Bateman's battalion.  This was in the early days of
the war, before the magnitude of the struggle had been generally
realized, and there were those who had tried to persuade
Professor Bateman that his higher duty lay at home.  His
address was prompted in part by this circumstance, and was a
vindication of his enlisting.  It was also prompted by a
colleague's address from the same platform contrasting Samuel,
who "hewed Agag in pieces," with Christ, Who commanded
Peter to "put up the sword"&mdash;a plea for the peaceful
settlement of personal and national disputes.  Professor Bateman
had for several years declined to address the University
Y.M.C.A., because he had never before felt that he had a
message for them.</i>
</p>

<p class="intro">
<i>So, although there is here much of the young man glorying
in his strength and rejoicing to run the race, the address was
not penned without thought and consideration.</i>
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We hear much, perhaps too much, at the present
time of the horrors of war; I wish to-day
to speak to you of its blessings.  Far be it from me
to minimize the dark side of war.  Only those who
have actually experienced warfare can form an
adequate idea of the horrors of campaigns and
battlefields.  But I wish to impress on you to-day
the fact that war has compensations, and that it is
by no means an unmitigated evil.
</p>

<p>
The Power Who manifests Himself to us in the
phenomena of this Universe has apparently decreed
that war should be the supreme test of both the nation
and the individual.  Biologically, struggle and
self-sacrifice by one generation on behalf of the next are
the conditions of the perpetuation of a species.  A
similar law of competition seems to hold for those
aggregates of men which we call nations.  History
teaches that once a nation ceases to struggle or to be
prepared to struggle for its existence, once it loses its
military spirit and the willingness to fight to the
death, if need be, for its national honour, its greatness
invariably declines, and its growth ceases.
</p>

<p>
Of course, competition among nations may be
carried on by other means than by war.  Commercial
rivalry, diplomatic rivalry, artistic rivalry, are all
important means of progress, but war is the one
supreme, the only entirely adequate test of a nation's
spiritual quality.
</p>

<p>
Readiness for war is a token of national righteousness.
In the sense in which I use the words, readiness
for war does not mean a national spirit of militarism
and aggressiveness, the spirit which has so often
proved the downfall of great military powers.  It is a
readiness which is the result of a clean and vigorous
national life during times of peace; a readiness which
springs not so much from direct military training
as from a high national idea of physical and mental
fitness.  The ideal soldier is not he who has been
drilled into a military machine in times of peace, but
he who is physically and mentally fit to become an
efficient soldier, if need be, on short notice in time
of war.
</p>

<p>
Self-sacrifice, self-denial, temperance, hardihood,
discipline, obedience, order, method, organizing
power, intelligence, purity of public life, chastity,
industry, resolution are some only of the national
and individual attributes which go towards producing
the efficiency of modern armaments.
</p>

<p>
The broad rule which one deduces from a general
survey of the history of human progress&mdash;a rule
to which, no doubt, some exceptions can be found&mdash;is
that the failure of nations to meet the test of war
has always been the result of the decay of national
morality, and that success in war has been an
indication of national virtue.  Right has not, indeed,
always been might, but right has always tended to
create might.
</p>

<p>
Rome conquered Greece because her sons were
hardier, stronger, and more imbued with the spirit
of self-sacrifice; Rome herself, centuries later, fell a
victim to the inroads of the Goths because of the
corruption of her national virtue and the decay of
her military spirit through self-indulgence and
immorality.  The refined sensuality of the Roman
could not withstand the rude virtue of the barbarian.
"And generally," to quote Harold Wyatt, "history
has repeatedly proved that efficiency in war, or for
war, is God's test of a nation's soul.  By that test it
stands, or by that test it falls.  This is the ethical
content of competition.  This is the determining
factor of human history.  This is the justification
of war."
</p>

<p>
The terrible punishment provided by war for
national depravity has been, perhaps, the chief
stimulus in the progress of mankind.  Behind the
horror and havoc of the field of battle, therefore, is
working a Power which makes for righteousness,
and which has ordained that the nation which, from
the righteousness of its cause and its fitness to defend
that cause, best deserves the victory, shall win it.
</p>

<p>
Such is apparently the law of human progress, and
we must accept it as we accept other seemingly
unpleasant facts of our present existence; as we
accept, for example, the fact of death.  It is only
by death that life is possible; it is only by struggle
and self-sacrifice that national progress is possible.
</p>

<p>
Do not, therefore, be lulled into a sense of false
security by the talk of universal peace, or by assertions
that the present war must be the last in human
history; but determine that, should you have the
opportunity, you will do your part to make the nation
to which you belong fit for its supreme test, the test
of war.  If you do not, you are a traitor to the past
generations who won by struggle and self-sacrifice the
heritage which you now enjoy, and to the future
generations, who demand that you shall pass on that
heritage, not diminished, but increased.
</p>

<p>
But take care that you do not mistake a national
spirit of greed and aggressiveness for virtue.
Remember Kipling's warning that military force should
be used only for the defence or enforcement of just
rights or for those which you truly and firmly believe
to be just.

<p class="noindent">
National greed and aggressiveness must, sooner or
later, bring their own punishment.
</p>

<p>
Now let us look at war from the standpoint of the
individual.  The sacrifice of individual lives is for
many men the most prominent fact of war.  They
look upon a field of battle, and are filled with dismay
at the sight of heaped-up carnage and garments rolled
in blood, but fail to find there the radiance of high
endeavour and the glow of great achievement.  Like
Carlyle, in his famous <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of war
in the <i>Sartor</i>, they see only the physical side of war,
and neglect its ethical and spiritual content.  Of
course, this is a piece of perversity on Carlyle's part.
</p>

<p class="quote">
What, speaking in quite unofficial language, is the
net-purport and upshot of war?  To my own knowledge, for
example, there dwell and toil, in the British village of
Dumdrudge usually some five hundred souls.  From these,
by certain "Natural Enemies" of the French, there are
successively selected, during the French war, say thirty
able-bodied men: Dumdrudge, at her own expense, has suckled
and nursed them: she has, not without difficulty and sorrow,
fed them up to manhood, and even trained them to crafts,
so that one can weave, another build, another hammer, and
the weakest can stand under thirty stone avoirdupois.
Nevertheless, amid much weeping and swearing, they are
selected; all dressed in red; and shipped away, at the public
charges, some two-thousand miles, or say only to the south
of Spain; and fed there till wanted.  And now to that same
spot, in the south of Spain, are thirty similar French artisans,
from a French Dumdrudge, in like manner wending: till at
length, after infinite effort, the two parties come into actual
juxtaposition: and Thirty stands fronting Thirty, each with
a gun in his hand.  Straightway the word "Fire!" is given:
and they blow the souls out of one another; and in place of
sixty brisk useful craftsmen the world has sixty dead
carcasses, which it must bury, and anew shed tears for.  Had
these men any quarrel?  Busy as the Devil is, not the
smallest!  They lived far enough apart; were the entirest
strangers; nay, in so wide a Universe, there was even,
unconsciously, by Commerce, some mutual helpfulness between
them.  How then?  Simpleton! their Governors had fallen-out;
and instead of shooting one another, had the cunning
to make these poor blockheads shoot.  Alas, so it is in
Deutschland, and hitherto in all other lands; still as of old,
"what devilry soever Kings do, the Greeks must pay the
piper!"  In that fiction of the English Smollett, it is true, the
final Cessation of War is perhaps prophetically shadowed
forth; where the two Natural Enemies, in person, take each
a Tobacco-pipe, filled with Brimstone; light the same, and
smoke in one another's faces, till the weaker gives in: but
from such predicted Peace-Era, what blood-filled trenches,
and contentious centuries, may still divide us!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But what if these men of Dumdrudge are not
blockheads at all, but high-souled, clear-sighted men?
What if they do not go to the war because their rulers
tell them to, but because they believe in the justice
of their cause, and consider it not only a duty but a
privilege to lay down their lives, if necessary, to
maintain it?
</p>

<p>
Tennyson gets a nearer view of the truth in <i>Maud</i>,
when he represents war as the purifier which purges
the corruption of a too-long-continued peace, and
which saves nation and individual alike from sloth
and selfishness.  Peace under a just and beneficent
government is surely a blessing of the first magnitude.
But those who enjoy it, and surely this applies to us,
must never forget at what price that blessing was
bought and at what price it must be maintained.
They must not grow petty and self-indulgent, and
forget that they possess a heritage won for them by the
sacrifice of others.  Is it not far better that they should
feel a thrill of patriotism at the rude touch of war,
and die striking a blow for freedom, than that they
should live to a dishonoured old age, seeking beggarly
gain?  Let us have less talk of the horrors of war and
more talk of its blessings.
</p>

<p>
Most of those who speak of "the horrors of war"
fail to recognize that it is those horrors which give
war its great, its inestimable value.  It would, no
doubt, be very pleasant if war could be conducted
in a polite and gentlemanly way, if it could be
arranged that nobody would get killed, and that
wounds and bloodshed would be reduced to a
minimum.  If that were so, we could all play at the game.
But where would be our heroes, our hearts of triple
steel?  Where would be their victories over death
and the fear of death, and their leading of captivity
captive?  We could then, like Falstaff, fill up our
armies with "toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their
bellies no bigger than pins' heads," and nobody would
be a jot the worse.  But war robbed of its terror
would be war without glory, and one of the greatest
and grandest of experiences which Destiny allows
to man would no longer be possible.  To endure gladly
the most severe labour and hardship, to grapple
with a mortal foe in deadly strife, a strife without
mercy and without remorse, to pass through Hell
unterrified, to wrest one's life by main force from the
very jaws of death, and to do all this, not for pay,
but for one's country, this is, perhaps, the very
climax of human endeavour.
</p>

<p>
And what of the many who do not win through,
but must leave their bodies upon the field of battle?
We may not agree with Horace that such a death is
"sweet and becoming," but surely it is sweeter and
more becoming than the majority of deaths which
men are called on to endure.  Who would not rather
die in the fullness of strength, with the shout of battle
upon his lips, than succumb to the attacks of some
disease which degrades the body and unhinges the
mind, and pass away at last from a fleshly house
that is no longer fit for the soul to inhabit, wringing
the hearts of the bystanders with incoherent babblings?
</p>

<p>
The death roll of war, still far from complete,
reaches back into the unfathomable past which lies
far beyond the ken of man.  The immensity of that
death roll is dreadful to contemplate.  But a past
unstained by the blood of human strife would be more
dreadful still.  No doubt there would be to-day more
people living in the world, but those high virtues
which are realized to the full in war and war alone&mdash;courage
and self-sacrifice&mdash;would be dead beyond
all hope of resurrection.  It was war which gave
birth to the ideals of chivalry and honour; it is war
which keeps those ideals alive in an age of sordid
commercialism.  It is the possibility of war, however
remotely realized, which makes our young men keep
their bodies clean and strong, and their souls free
from that lowest form of selfishness, the selfishness
of Parolles, which puts life before honour, which says:
</p>

<p>
"Let me live, sir, in a dungeon, in the stocks, or
anywhere, so I may live."
</p>

<p>
When the more dangerous of lower animals have
been tamed or exterminated, when locomotion by
land, air, and sea has become safe and easy,
when&mdash;greatest blessing of all&mdash;war has ceased to exist,
then surely we shall see the return of the Golden Age.
Perhaps so, but it will be a Golden Age enjoyed by a
spineless and emasculated race of beings, who have
forgotten the meaning of the words courage, honour,
and self-sacrifice.

<h3>
IN THE TRENCHES
</h3>

<p class="intro">
<i>An address given in Saskatoon to a number of returned
men and colleagues on the first anniversary of the battle of
St. Julien.  Professor Bateman had been recalled from France
to take command of the Saskatchewan Company of the Western
Universities' Battalion.</i>
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Twelve months ago, on April 22nd, when day
broke upon the battlefields of Flanders, the
new Canadian army, which had wallowed all winter
in the mud of Salisbury, had yet to prove their mettle
as fighting men.  Ere the sun set that day, they had
already won the title, given them throughout the
Empire when the story of the fight was known, of
"Glorious Canadians."  The reputation won at Ypres
and St. Julien was fully maintained at the battles of
Festubert and Givenchy.
</p>

<p>
Although we soldiers of the Second Contingent
experienced fighting on a smaller scale than our
comrades of the First, we had quite enough to enable us
to realize, as one who has not been there never can,
a great deal of what the first lot went through.  I
think it is no exaggeration to say that no soldiers
of the Second or succeeding contingents think it
necessary to look anywhere but to the First Canadians
for their highest example of self-sacrifice and devotion
to duty.
</p>

<p>
I have heard people at home complain that they
find it hard to get any information from returned
soldiers as to their experience, or to get any real idea
of what the fighting is like.  I think the reason is that
we are afraid of giving people a false impression, and
that it is impossible to make people grasp the reality
of conditions of warfare which have no parallel in
history.  Everybody at home expects a tale of glory
and heroism, but the days of pomp and circumstance
of battle are over, and it is only the ideals for which
we are fighting that can dignify the mean and ugly
reality of present-day war.  Besides, when I look
back upon the one or two little affairs out of the
common in which I have taken part, my impressions
are a curious mixture of distinctness and vagueness,
as of a dream or nightmare rather than of a real
experience, and such impressions are difficult to put
into words.
</p>

<p>
I was in and out of the trenches for six months as
an N.C.O., and was in the front line every time but
one, so that as far as the ordinary routine of trench
life goes, I am qualified to speak.  The shortest phrase
I know of which attempts to sum up life in the
trenches is "Days of unendurable monotony and
moments of indescribable fear."  That phrase, as
far as it goes, is a good description, but it leaves
out two important aspects of trench life, the humorous
and the picturesque.  It is only a sense of humour
that can make the monotony of trench life endurable.
Any man who went up to the front line expecting
to find the heroic defenders grimly defiant and serious
over their task would probably be more shocked than
amused to find men busy arguing over the division
of a pot of jam while Fritz was generously spraying
our line with shrapnel; or to discover that some
fellow was more elated over having swiped someone
else's brazier than if he had bayonetted a dozen
Fritzes; or to discover that the breaking of a rum
jar was considered a greater calamity by the whole
company than if our trench had been blown to pieces.
</p>

<p>
I have often sat in my dug-out, just a little way
down the communication trench, and listened to a
ration party going up to the front line in the dark
with their heavy loads, wading through mud, plunging
into holes, falling over broken trench mats, and I have
heard with great pleasure the flow of language; it
was immense, nothing like it is to be heard from any
other troops in the world's history.
</p>

<p>
And then there was the picturesque side.  My
recollections of the trenches come back to me chiefly
as a series of pictures.
</p>

<p>
I see the velvety blackness of the night, cut by
streaks of light as the flares go up continually along
the front, as far as the eye can see, then shed their
weird radiance over the mysterious region of No
Man's Land, while every moving thing beneath their
light lies still as death till darkness comes again to
hide them from the searching eyes that never cease
to scan the space between the trenches.  I see the
muffled sentries at their posts on the firing step;
I hear the irregular <i>crack, crack</i> of rifle fire along the
line as they shoot at a flash from the other trench,
or at some moving object dimly seen through the
darkness; then comes the sharp crackle of rifle fire
or the <i>rat-a-tat-tat</i> of the machine-gun as we open
upon one of Fritz's working parties.  I see the flash
and hear the bang of bursting shrapnel, or the distant
<i>woosh</i> and <i>cr-r-rump</i> of the high explosive; or there
is the dull <i>pop</i> from Fritz's line, and high in the air a
tract of light makes its way towards our trench.
We hear the familiar <i>whoo-oo-oo-oosh</i>, and we know
that one of the dreaded aerial torpedoes is on its
way; we wait with horrible suspense for the sickening
thud and roar of the explosion, and wonder whether
it has got anyone this time, and whether the next
is coming our way; or we are roughly awakened
from the deep sleep of exhaustion by someone
excitedly pulling at our legs and shouting, "Gas!"  We
crawl quickly out of the dug-out into the darkness
to find our comrades "standing to" all along the
trench in their weird gas helmets, and presently
discover with relief that a nervous listening post has
mistaken the mist, which is rolling up from Fritz's
trench, for the dreaded chlorine.  Or we turn from
our posts as we hear the shuffle of the stretcher-bearers
along the trench, and we wish some unlucky
(or lucky) comrade a safe passage to Blighty.  Then
there are nights to look back upon around the
battered old brazier in the dug-out, when things
were quiet, and we smoked a pipe or sang a song,
and thought of what we should do when we got that
leave that never seemed to come, or the "rest"
which had been promised us every time we came out
of the trenches for the last three months.  And then
there was the tramp back to billets through the
shell-torn streets of a deserted Flemish village, and the
blessed relief of flinging down the pack and rolling
up in our blankets for the first straight sleep of many
nights.
</p>

<p>
But best of all to look back upon are the good
comrades we found in the trenches, whom we knew
we could trust to the death, if need be.  However
much we appreciate the comfort of home and the
kindness of friends here, the deepest thoughts of
every returned soldier are now, and will ever be
while this war lasts, with the boys they left behind
them, "holding the line."

<h3>
ON THE DEATH OF A COMRADE
</h3>

<p class="intro">
<i>Written in England while impatiently waiting to get back
to France.  Professor Bateman had been recalled from the
trenches, where he was sergeant, to become major of the Western
Universities' Battalion, and then was forced to wait in England
after this unit was broken up, while in France his former
battalion was preparing for Vimy.  This letter was written
shortly after its capture.</i>
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
April 29th, 1917.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Dear J. V.,
</p>

<p>
"Letter received and contents noted."
</p>

<p>
I can understand how you feel about Maunsell's
death.  Personally, I have long ago given up
theorizing about what may or may not be at the back
of phenomena.  I confine myself to what I can see
and know and reason about, and I find that I have
quite as much as I can handle even in that narrow
sphere.  Once one gets into the region of the
supernatural, one man's dream or speculation is just as
good or as worthless as another's, for neither has any
foundation in experience, and experience gives us
our only possible basis for the construction of theories
about life.
</p>

<p>
So, though you may allow your thoughts at times
to get out of hand and wander about gropingly in a
nebulous unknown, you ought not to allow any
baseless theories that result to disturb your peace
of mind.  If you attach any importance to such
propositions about the unknown, you can find plenty
of comforting ones evolved by greater brains than
yours, which you would do better to accept than allow
yourself to be worried and made less effective for
the business of life by the pessimistic result of your
own thinking.
</p>

<p>
Constant brain work has a tendency to make a man
morbid in his speculations.  A free, open-air life,
practical problems and contact with men who do
things rather than theorize about them is a great
corrective.  No one yet has gone anywhere near
solving the riddle of the unknown, and it may fairly
be supposed that the human brain is at present
incapable of tackling the problem successfully.  It
may be that the perpetual struggle after a solution
may, in ages to come, result in the evolution of a
brain which can find an answer to the riddle of life,
in the same way as the constant reaching of the
giraffe after food resulted in the production of a neck
sufficiently long to solve the giraffe's food problem.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, we must be content to get along with
such knowledge as we have, or else accept a supernatural
revelation which is bound at the best to be
a bit dim and unsatisfactory, because it is communicated
to us by means of the same imperfect brain.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I don't think it matters very much
what you believe about the supernatural if you base
your actions upon a sane view of what experience
has shown to be best.  To get and give as much
happiness as possible seems to be our plain duty, and
if abnormalities on a tremendous scale like this war
crop up, it is the duty of every one to get to work and
sacrifice, if necessary, his own chance of happiness
in order to restore a state of things where happiness
is possible for others.  (By happiness, I mean contentment,
usually temporary, with things as they are.)
</p>

<p>
Experience has given us ample proof of where
happiness is to be found as far as it can be realized
in this life, and every one ought to be able to avoid
those actions which would seem to bring happiness,
but which have been shown by experience to result
in the long run in dissatisfaction.  Of course, very
few are wise enough to accept the experience of others,
and most men have to get stung many times over
before they learn the lessons which countless billions
before them learned in precisely the same way.
</p>

<p>
Curiously enough, the highest happiness of which
humans are capable seems to be found in the sacrifice
of self.  Maunsell's magnificent devotion to duty and
splendid death are of far greater value to us than his
continuing to live could have been, and though he
could not have fully realized that fact himself, he
certainly would not have been happy if he had
declined the privilege of giving up his own happiness
that general happiness might be secured for the world,
thereby paradoxically finding the greatest happiness
of all.  If he still continues to live, and can look
back on earthly experiences, he would probably not
desire to change his own fate.
</p>

<p>
You can see from all this that my desire to get
back to the front is, in the main, selfish.  I simply
cannot be content to stay here handling a job which
absorbs scarcely any of my ability or energy, and
which could be as well or better done by some one who
is not fit to fight.  I went away from the front with
the full intention of returning there with men whom
I had trained to take their part in the scrap.  I have
been prevented by circumstances from carrying out
my scheme, and I shall always regret that I did not
consider that those who were actually at the front
with me had a greater claim on me than any others.
If I had stayed on, I should have got my commission
and should have valued it much more than the one
I actually did get.  I might have been killed, but I
was prepared for that, and I think there is no better
way a man can die.  It is comparatively seldom in
the world's history that a man gets the chance to
die splendidly.  Most deaths are somewhat inglorious
endings to not very glorious careers.  A war like the
present gives a man a chance to cancel at one stroke
all the pettiness of his life.
</p>

<p>
Therefore I think it is up to me to do all I can to
get back to France and finish what I began.  If I fail
to get there, it won't be my fault, and I won't worry
about it.  If I depended on the powers that be, I
should probably be here for the duration of the war,
and it is possible that I may be.  But I am determined
that it is not going to be my fault if I am.
</p>

<p>
I did not intend, when I sat down, to write you
more than a brief note.  I think my first sentence
shows that.  All the rest came of itself, and I hope
you won't be bored stiff by reading it.
</p>

<p>
If you are ever up against it for cash, or if there
is any other way that I can help you, I shall be very
sore with you if you don't let me know.

<p>
If you want some good light reading to take your
mind off Syriac and other ancient noises by which
people communicated one with the other, try some

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
